      "title": "Tax credit could lift Hawaii families out of poverty",
      "publication": "Yahoo!News",
      "excerpt": "Jul. 16—The great majority of Hawaii families with children under age 18 should receive monthly payments of up to $300 for each child starting this week as part of a pandemic stimulus package that is expected to provide help to struggling families and potentially propel thousands of children out of poverty.\n\nBut local advocacy groups warn that some of the poorest families could lose out if they aren't provided with assistance in signing up for the expanded child tax credit, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden as part of the.\n\n\"These are the families that definitely need this kind of help the most, but without good community outreach a lot of them are going to miss out, \" said Nicole Woo, director of research and economic policy for the Hawaii Children's Action Network.\n\nThe monthly payments, which will go through the end of the year, could lift 43, 000 children in Hawaii above or closer to the poverty line, according to a state. Overall, 278, 000, or 92 % of the state's children, are expected to benefit from the child credit.\n\nThe enhanced credit gives nearly all families $3, 000 to $3, 600 per child this year. A couple earning up to $150, 000 will receive the full credit, as will single parents making up to $112, 500. Half of the tax credit is being distributed in monthly payments of $250 for children ages 6 to 17 and $300 for children under 6. Those payments are slated to continue through December. The other half is credited when families file their taxes for 2021.\n\nThe federal government has had a child tax credit in place for about two dec ­ades, which in recent years has provided a tax credit of $2, 000 for every child under 17. That credit has been nonrefundable, however, and families with very low incomes often haven't been able to benefit from it, said Woo. This year's credit is refundable, which provides families with the benefit regardless of their tax liability status.\n\nThose changes expand the benefit of the credit to lower-income families. Nationally, at least 27 million more children from the expanded child tax credit, including 92, 000 in Hawaii.\n\nSupporters of this year's child tax credit are hoping it will become a permanent part of the American safety net.\n\n\"With many of our safety net programs, it is based on poverty and it is really restrictive, and if you go up a dollar above the eligibility level, then you don't get anything, \" said Beth Giesting, director of the Hawai 'i Budget & Policy Center. \"So it is really great for families to have the money to use how they need it most.\"\n\nThe enhanced tax credit also does not count as income, so should not affect other safety net programs, such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which provides food assistance.\n\nFamilies who didn't make enough to be required to file tax returns for 2019 or 2020 still qualify for the benefit and can sign up through a at bit.ly /3zhNAZB by providing basic information, including their name, current mailing address, email address, date of birth, bank account information if they have one, as well as Social Security numbers for themselves and their dependents.\n\nWoo said it was important to conduct outreach with homeless shelters and social service providers to make sure that Hawaii's most economically vulnerable are aware of the tax credits and how to sign up, if they haven't been automatically entered.------More information about the expanded child tax credit can be found on the following web pages :—Hawaii Children's Action Network :—White House :",

      "publication": "Star Advertiser",
      "excerpt": "Hawaii workers would have access to several weeks of paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a family member under proposed legislation advancing in both the House and Senate.\n\nWhile some employers offer paid family leave benefits, federal and state laws mandate only certain employers to provide unpaid leave for eligible family and medical reasons.\n\nUnder the federal Family Medical Leave Act, public agencies and employers with 50 or more workers have to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave annually. The Hawaii Family Leave Law also requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide up to four weeks of unpaid family leave a year.\n\nSenate Bill 2990 and House Bill 2598 would pave the way for a state-managed paid family leave program. The nearly identical bills direct the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations to come up with administrative rules by Jan. 1, 2020, to “establish and codify paid family leave for all workers in the state.”\n\nThe bills say the rules would need to create a program that includes coverage for all employees of employers that employ one or more employees; job protection for employees who use paid family leave; an unspecified minimum number of weeks of leave; and a system of so-called progressive wage replacement that allows low-income workers to receive a higher percentage of weekly earnings.\n\nIf approved, the remaining details of the program would be fine-tuned by an “implementation board” made up of stakeholders and experts including large- and small-business owners, labor unions, state department heads and family leave advocates. The board would be tasked with analyzing potential models and the associated costs to implement and sustain each model.\n\nThe bills direct the board to consider at least two models: a so-called social insurance program where payroll deductions would be used to fund the program, and an expansion of temporary disability insurance to provide paid family leave.\n\nThe House Labor and Public Employment Committee and the Senate Labor Committee voted Tuesday to advance the measures.\n\n“Everybody recognizes how unaffordable living in Hawaii is. And it’s particularly unaffordable when someone is faced with the choice of having to care for a loved or go to work,” said Rep. Aaron Ling Johanson, chairman of the House Labor and Public Employment Committee. “Right now that’s the choice that so many are faced with because even if they can take family leave, it’s unpaid.”\n\nSupporters of paid family leave, many of them mothers with young children in tow, gathered Tuesday at the state Capitol to rally in support of the measures.\n\nJessica McDonald shared a personal experience that ended tragically for her family.\n\nMcDonald said she had to return to work a few weeks after she and her husband had a baby girl, Quinn, about a year ago. She exhausted her paid vacation and sick leave benefits six weeks after Quinn’s birth, and the couple placed the baby in day care.\n\n“It was not financially possible for me to go without pay any longer,” she said.\n\nThe baby became suddenly ill while at day care two days after McDonald returned to work.\n\n“I rushed her to the hospital, where she passed away shortly after arriving,” McDonald said, holding back sobs. “While I’ll never know if I could have saved Quinn, what I do know is that I spent Quinn’s last day at work … and this will forever haunt me.”\n\nA 2014 report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, found the United States and Papua New Guinea are the only two countries that provide no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave.\n\nFour individual states — California, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island — do offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes.\n\nDeborah Zysman, executive director of Hawaii Children’s Action Network, which helped organize Tuesday’s rally with the Hawaii Working Families Coalition, said a recent study found the average worker here would pay roughly $57 a year if Hawaii were to adopt the insurance model of using payroll deductions from all workers, regardless of employer size, to fund family leave benefits.\n\n“We all as workers would pay in, like Social Security,” Zysman said. “And when you then have a qualifying life event … you would apply to the state, saying, ‘I want the benefit.’”\n\nShe said the proposal would help prevent employees from going into debt or poverty to take care of their families.\n\n“People are already taking leave; they’re just going broke to do it,” Zysman said. “They’re tapping into their 401(k) if they have it or maxing out their credit cards. That’s how people take leave now.”\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce Hawaii, Retail Merchants of Hawaii and Hawaii Restaurant Association oppose the bills.",

      "title": "Preschool in Hawaii Ridiculously Expensive and Hard to Find",
      "publication": "Civil Beat",
      "excerpt": "Hawaii lags much of the nation in spending on state-funded preschool. But it is taking new steps to expand access, including opening five new classrooms next year.\n\nWhen it came time to find a public preschool for his 4-year-old son this school year, James Peck was one of the luckier parents.\n\nHis son, Leo, is one of 15 kids enrolled in the inaugural preschool program at Kamalani Academy, a new Hawaiian-focused arts integration charter school in Wahiawa that serves pre-kindergarten through grade 8.\n\n“As everybody knows, pre-K is ridiculously hard to find —  free public free-K,” Peck said as he accompanied his son on the first day of preschool. “I’m going to presume this is going to be really hard to get into later on when people find out about it.”\n\nFinding affordable preschool for children remains a challenge for families in Hawaii. A private preschool in Hawaii can cost hundreds of dollars a month or even exceed $1,000 for families, depending on the program and age level it serves.\n\nThe $11,232 average annual price tag of center-based child care for a 4-year-old in Hawaii is highest in the nation as a percentage of median income for married couples, according to Child Care Aware of America.\n\nAnd Hawaii ranks at the bottom of states when it comes to access to public preschool, according to a 2016 report by the National Institute for Early Education Research. Only 2 percent of all 4-year-old children in the state were enrolled in state-funded public pre-K in the 2015-16 school year, compared with the national average of 32 percent.\n\nWhile the Hawaii Department of Education no longer tracks statewide the percentage of students who attended preschool prior to enrolling in kindergarten, the most recent data from the 2013-14 school year show the rate is about 50 percent. There were 13,427 kindergarteners at the start of the 2017-18 school year, according to the latest state Department of Education enrollment numbers.\n\nCompared with other states, “Hawaii has been moving really, really slow” when it comes to access to early childhood care and public preschool, said Deborah Zysman, executive director of Hawaii Children’s Action Network.\n\nBut there have been incremental changes over the last year, including increased funding from the Legislature that will add five new pre-K classrooms in the 2018-19 school year and more authority to an early education advisory board.\n\n“I think it’s going to add some sense of strength and permanency to the idea of ‘yes, we are working towards … universal pre-K,’ because it’s a really small universe right now,” said Jonathan Gillentine, a retired early childhood and special education teacher in Hawaii, of the new governing board.\n\nSmall Steps\nKamalani, which as a public charter school is tuition-free, is one of 18 public charter pre-K classrooms across 13 schools in Hawaii funded through a four-year $14.7 million preschool development grant issued under the Obama administration.\n\nStatewide, the grant has the capacity to serve 360 4-year-olds. But enrollment is first-come, first-serve and limited to families whose income falls at or below 200 percent of the current federal poverty guidelines.\n\nIt comes as a relief to parents like Bryan Hemric, whose daughter is a preschooler at Kamalani. “There are a lot of (private) pre-K programs, but the waiting lists are huge, they’re very expensive, so it’s almost not practical (to enroll),” he said. “That’s a huge benefit of this. It’s free.”\n\nWith $3 million in legislative funding that was authorized in 2014, Hawaii’s Executive Office on Early Learning — an office established under former Gov. Neil Abercrombie — launched 20 preschool classrooms in 18 public schools statewide. Nine alone are located on Hawaii Island.\n\nAdditional funding this past session will help bring five new pre-K classes next year into schools that were selected based on factors such as existing availability of preschools in the area, Title I status since there are income requirements for eligibility and buy-in from school administrators.\n\n“The most important factor was principal interest and commitment to the program,” said Lauren Moriguchi, executive director of EOEL.\n\nThe five new preschool classrooms that will open in 2018 are at Kohala Elementary on Hawaii Island, Kula Elementary on Maui, Kilohana Elementary on Molokai, and Kailua Elementary and Kalihi Uka Elementary on Oahu.\n\nBy 2018-19, the 23 public preschool classrooms will have the capacity to serve 520 kids.\n\nPriority is reserved for children in special education, English language learners and for families who earn at or less than 250 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four that means earning no more than $70,725 per year for a child to be eligible.\n\nImportance of Preschool\nEarly child education experts say that preschool is a crucial and fundamental step to preparing kids for kindergarten. They learn how to play and socialize with their peers, strengthen fine motor skills by using their hands and fingers and learn basic rules like how to share and wait their turn.\n\nThere are other routes to free preschool in Hawaii, including federally funded programs like Head Start, and through state subsidy programs administered by the state Department of Human Services, such as Preschool Open Doors and Child Care Connection Hawaii, both of which have income requirements.\n\nIn the 2015-16 school year, Head Start, which serves 3- and 4-year-olds, served 2,440 kids in Hawaii, according to the NIEER report. There are 120 Head Start classrooms statewide, plus 18 “Early Head Start” classrooms, which serves infants to children age two.\n\nPreschool Open Doors last year reached approximately 1,201 children, according to a 2016 DHS Annual Report. Funding for the program was also raised from $6 million to $10 million in 2016.\n\n“Access to high-quality early care and education is essential to children’s readiness for school and success in life,” EOEL’s Moriguchi said. “A growing body of evidence suggests this is particularly true for children from low-income families, who may face obstacles related to poverty, geographic and social isolation, insufficient home resources and instability.”\n\nOne school that’s trying to address that is Linapuni Elementary, a school in Kalihi that serves only pre-K and first-graders from the nearby public housing projects. It has three preschool classes, including one operated through Head Start. More than half the student body consists of English language learners, with many students from Micronesia or the Marshall Islands who speak only Chuukese or Marshallese.\n\nThe preschool classrooms are separated into play areas that contain wooden blocks, Legos or Play-Doh and stations set up for finger-painting or using the water table.\n\nOn a recent morning at Linapuni, Head Start teacher Cherie Yamashiroya was seated in a circle among her preschoolers, leading them in a song.\n\n“We do a lot with the families. I had to learn that my way isn’t the only way to teach,” Yamashiroya said of her inclusion class, referring to working with families from various cultural backgrounds.\n\nHer teacher’s aide, Yukie Esah, speaks Chuukese, so she’s able to communicate with students from Micronesia that don’t speak English.\n\nA couple classrooms away, veteran pre-K teacher Colleen Uejo sat with a student who was concentrating on molding Play-Doh into various shapes. Uejo, whose class includes special education inclusion students, says one of the most important aspects of teaching 4-year-olds is talking to them.\n\n“For the kids in this district, they really need the opportunity to build, create and think,” she said. “A lot of the kids from the housing, they’re very quiet, they just look at you. We do a lot of talking to them.”\n\n“This is the year they grow the most, learning how to stand in line, wait their turn,” she added. “If you’re just at home, and watching TV, playing on the iPad, no one’s talking to you.”\n\nResearch shows that 92 percent of a child’s brain development occurs by age 5, the age typically when a child enters kindergarten. A high-quality pre-K program, experts say, is crucial to developing skills such as learning rules, socializing with peers and being in a structured environment.\n\nFor kids without any preschool experience, “they kind of get slammed in kindergarten,” said Gillentine, the retired teacher and early education specialist. “They come in with no school experience, they don’t really understand the culture of what school is. They’re kind of left standing in the dust, and quite often the teachers are stuck.”\n\nParents who have gone through the experience agree.\n\n“You can see the difference between the kids who went through pre-K and the kids who haven’t gone through pre-K. It’s night and day,” said Peck, who also has a daughter in the fourth grade who attended pre-K at Leeward Community College Children’s Center. “She went into kindergarten running instead of crawling.”\n\nAkeyo Garcia, a pre-K teacher at Kamalani Academy who previously taught kindergarteners at Ewa Elementary School, says she noticed immediately which of her students had attended preschool and which had not.\n\n“As a former kindergarten teacher, what we struggled with most is that children don’t have self-regulations when they come in: they don’t know how to share, they don’t know how to listen, they don’t know how to take turns — basically, all the skills they need to start learning,” she said.\n\nThe preschool development grant is able to fund things like free meals for Kamalani’s preschoolers, but expires after the 2018-19 school year, leaving the long-term future of the program in question. Garcia calls the funds “kick-start money.”\n\n“Many of us are fighting with the state or city or anyone that listens for funds for publicly funded pre-K in the state,” she said.\n\nHawaii’s constitution bars the use of state funds to support private educational institutions. A ballot initiative in the November 2014 election to amend the state constitution to allow for a public-private preschool delivery system was defeated by voters.\n\nThe state’s inability to use public funds for private provider contracts — like the model adopted in New York City – puts the state in a bit of a vise, said Zysman, of Children’s Action Network. But the issue goes beyond just funding to more deep-seated challenges.\n\n“Even if someone said, we can put a billion dollars into this (effort), we don’t have teachers ready to go or workforce development, we don’t have sites,” she noted. “There needs to be a whole ramp-up.”\n\nThe Executive Office on Early Learning has received in-kind support from the Omidyar Group and Collaborative Leaders Network, another Omidyar organization.

      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Hawaii’s first ever civic engagement app, KĀKOU, is putting the power of change in the palm of your hand. KĀKOU, an initiative of Pacific Resource Partnership (PRP), is a unified, digital platform that makes it easy for everyone to engage with Hawaii’s elected officials and participate in the democratic process.\n\nAfter taking over the publishing of the Hawaii Directory of Public Officials in 2018, PRP saw an opportunity to modernize the popular legislative resource guide and create KĀKOU – a tool for people of all ages to “Tap Into Democracy.” KĀKOU makes it easy for users to find and contact federal, state and county elected officials, register to vote, weigh in on hot button issues, email legislative committees, advocate alongside local nonprofit organizations, and more, on the convenience of a smartphone. KĀKOU is available for download on any Apple or Android phone, free of charge.\n\n“When you look around today, most people have no idea how to get involved in government and community issues, how to contact their elected officials, or even who their elected officials are. KĀKOU makes it easy to get involved, find and contact your elected officials, learn about issues that you care about, and more - right on your phone,” said Melanie Kim, PRP’s marketing manager. “Encouraging civic engagement and strengthening Hawaii’s community is at the core of PRP’s mission. We are excited to share KĀKOU to help empower Hawaii’s people and community.”\n\nState Senate President Ron Kouchi and House Speaker Scott Saiki are co-chairs of KĀKOU, and the app has been warmly received by legislators eager to reach a wide range of constituents.\n\nUnderstanding that meaningful change can’t be achieved by a single organization, PRP has partnered with six local non-profit organizations in the inaugural year of KĀKOU. The organizations represent a wide array of issue-areas and concerns to improve civic engagement and address vital community needs. Through KĀKOU, users can subscribe to follow organizations of interest, and organizations can inform their members and supporters of legislation, send out alerts and updates, and share engagement and advocacy opportunities. PRP will donate $1 per subscriber to each partnering community organization. KĀKOU’s founding partners are:\n\n● Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement\n\n● Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice\n\n● Hawaii Children’s Action Network\n\n● Hawaii Public Health Institute\n\n● HawaiiKidsCAN\n\n● Rainbow Family 808\n\n\"HawaiiKidsCAN is an organization fueled by the belief that civically engaged students and communities are necessary in order to build an equitable, innovative education system,\" said David Miyashiro, founding executive director of local non-profit organization HawaiiKidsCAN. \"KĀKOU is a powerful new game-changer that will make it easier than ever for our youth and residents to speak up and get involved. Given that we live in a push-button tech world, our democracy should reflect this same ease of connectivity and communication.\"\n\nPRP will host “Activate Hawaii 2019” - the official kick-off celebration of KĀKOU - on Wednesday, Feb. 6 from 5:30 - 8 pm at the Hawaii State Art Museum. The event is free and open to the public; registration is encouraged. Attendees must download KĀKOU, register for the app, and show their “KĀKOU USER ID” found in the user’s profile to enter. The event will celebrate the launch of KĀKOU, offer the public an opportunity to learn more about its founding partners, and inspire a new generation of civic engagement in Hawaii. Event kickoff begins at 5:30 pm, with a short program at 6:30 pm and live entertainment by Kapena to follow. Complimentary food and drinks will be provided.\n\nCopyright 2019 Hawaii News Now.

      "excerpt": "Hawaii’s Oldest, Successful Keiki Advocacy Group Rebrands as\nHawaii Children’s Action Network\n(HONOLULU, HI — November 12, 2015) —Good Beginnings Alliance (GBA), Hawaii’s leading nonprofit group for young children statewide, is now the Hawaii Children’s Action Network (HCAN).  \n\nThe nearly two-decade-old nonprofit has re-launched to achieve a broader goal of advocacy and community organizing to afford all Hawaii’s youngsters a healthy start in life.\n\nHawaii Children’s Action Network will focus on building grassroots support for children, from housing, health care, quality childcare and early education to other issues such as family leave. Children of families in poverty or living in communities with few resources continue to be the highest priority.\n\n\"Community leaders came together almost 20 years ago to start Good Beginnings Alliance, developing and growing sorely needed early childhood services across our islands,\" said Deborah Zysman, HCAN's executive director. \"They were pioneers, laying the groundwork for a new generation to help our kids get what they need to succeed.\"\n\n\"This evolution of mobilizing families, businesses, nonprofits and our leaders as a powerful voice for all our children has been phenomenal and I couldn't be more optimistic about HCAN's continuing that foundation,\" said Elisabeth (Liz) Chun, GBA executive director from 1997-2012.  \"This is a most critical quality of life issue facing our state. Building a thriving economy with a qualified and capable workforce depends on helping our kids get what they need now.\"\n\nThrough Act 77, GBA was established in 1996 to coordinate and develop early childhood services statewide. Since the act sunset in 2010, child advocates have reorganized and broadened the mission, which led to HCAN.\n\nHCAN’s immediate goals include raising $300,000, and strengthening the statewide coalition. The group will campaign for early health screenings, address child homelessness, work to bring together more than 50 children’s groups, establish a think tank focused on solutions, conduct advocacy training and launch a fellowship program for emerging leaders.\n\nHawaii data demonstrate the need for community organizing around children:\n\n\nMore of Hawaii kids are living in poverty: One out of five keiki.\n-This summer 7,260 people were identified as homeless in Hawaii; 2,200 were children.\n-Nearly 30 percent of parents lack secure employment.\n-More than 40 percent of children are living in households with a high housing cost burden.\n-Nearly half of Hawaii keiki don’t go to preschool. Children who do are 80 percent more likely to graduate from high school.\n-Two-thirds of Hawaii keiki don’t get simple screenings for developmental delays, to catch and treat things early, yet 30 percent are estimated to be at risk for a developmental delay.\n-Children in low-income families are twice as likely not to have access to health care and screenings. (Due to geographic isolation or a lack of service providers willing to take patients with certain medical coverage.)         \n\n-One-fourth of Hawaii kids don’t always have enough to eat.",

      "publication": "Star Advertiser",
      "excerpt": "The great majority of Hawaii families with children under age 18 should receive monthly payments of up to $300 for each child starting this week as part of a pandemic stimulus package that is expected to provide help to struggling families and potentially propel thousands of children out of poverty.\n\nBut local advocacy groups warn that some of the poorest families could lose out if they aren’t provided with assistance in signing up for the expanded child tax credit, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden as part of the American Rescue Plan.\n\n“These are the families that definitely need this kind of help the most, but without good community outreach a lot of them are going to miss out,” said Nicole Woo, director of research and economic policy for the Hawaii Children’s Action Network.\n\nThe monthly payments, which will go through the end of the year, could lift 43,000 children in Hawaii above or closer to the poverty line, according to a state analysis by the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. Overall, 278,000, or 92% of the state’s children, are expected to benefit from the child credit.\n\nThe enhanced credit gives nearly all families $3,000 to $3,600 per child this year. A couple earning up to $150,000 will receive the full credit, as will single parents making up to $112,500. Half of the tax credit is being distributed in monthly payments of $250 for children ages 6 to 17 and $300 for children under 6. Those payments are slated to continue through December. The other half is credited when families file their taxes for 2021.\n\nThe federal government has had a child tax credit in place for about two dec­ades, which in recent years has provided a tax credit of $2,000 for every child under 17. That credit has been nonrefundable, however, and families with very low incomes often haven’t been able to benefit from it, said Woo. This year’s credit is refundable, which provides families with the benefit regardless of their tax liability status.",

Focus areas are education, health and wellness, child welfare and safety, economic security and equity for children and family strengthening. The agenda was outlined this morning at the Hawaii State Capitol.\n\n“Hawaii has fallen behind in areas that measure how well our children are doing”, said Deborah Zysman, HCAN’s executive director. “We created this policy initiative to make sure we’re taking smart steps to get back on track.”\n\nRecommended measures include addressing topics from early education and paid family leave to homelessness.\n\n“These policy positions come from professionals and volunteers working directly with our kids, from people who know what needs to be fixed and how,” said Zysman.\n\n\nAbout the Hawaii Children’s Action Network\nThe Hawaii Children’s Action Network (HCAN) grew out of Good Beginnings Alliance (GBA), the veteran organization that for two decades has been focused on childhood issues. In 2015, the respected nonprofit was renamed to reflect a broader mission of expanded advocacy and community organizing to support all of Hawaii’s children.

      "publication": "Civil Beat",
      "excerpt": "Making Hawaii’s At-Risk Children A Priority\n\nThe odds are stacked against Hawaii’s at-risk children, and these inequities need to be addressed. Entering kindergarten, many children are up to a year behind their peers in skills like reading and counting, which leads to potential lost opportunities for attending higher education or attaining a career.\n\nFor young children, stable and consistent learning environments are critical for early brain development. Research underscores the benefits of high-quality early learning. Children have better cognitive and language skills and are better able to regulate their emotions and manage adversity. Having these skills at kindergarten entry can eliminate the achievement gap and the need for costly remediation.\n\nHawaii’s legislators have an opportunity to make a colossal impact on the lives of children and on our economic future. Bills that could positively impact Hawaii’s young children and families include those that would constructively effect early learning, homeless children and paid family leave.\n\nWith legislators under pressure to trim budgets, low-income working parents are facing a paradox. Just when they have to work longer hours to stay afloat, they are losing access to the thing they need most to stay on the job and prevent homelessness: a government subsidy that helps pay for child care.\n\nQuality child care is a key component to every state’s early childhood strategic plan. Child care helps communities prosper. It gives children the opportunity to learn and develop skills they need to succeed in school and in life. It gives parents the support and peace of mind they need to be a productive worker.\n\nHawaii has the highest rate of homelessness per capita in the nation. It is estimated that one-third of our homeless are children!\n\nWe should make a commitment to serve distinctive groups of the homeless, such as families with children, domestic violence victims and individuals with disabilities in ways that help address the specific issues they are facing.\n\nThe extraordinary demand placed on our workforce puts families in jeopardy. Workers often must choose between providing care to a newborn or incapacitated parent and making a living.\n\nAmericans put in more hours than workers in other industrialized countries, and have less time off. What’s more, the United States is the only developed nation that does not provide paid time away to care for family members.\n\nWomen provide the majority of unpaid care at home, despite also being the primary breadwinner in 40 percent of families. Paid family leave is, first and foremost, about equal opportunity for all. And for that reason, lawmakers must recognize that paid family leave is a civil rights issue.\n\nOnce again, our state Legislature has squandered the opportunity to pass a strong paid-family-leave policy this session. California is a good example of what we could bring to Hawaii with that kind of law. Their statewide paid-leave program provides support for new families, and led to 83 percent of workers using the program returning to their previous job.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that 87 percent of California businesses had no increased cost, and 9 percent said the program saved money by reducing employee turnover and saving them from paying their own benefit costs. Similar programs have also been working in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Washington and Washington D.C.\n\nIf Hawaii’s future is dependent on a reliable and well-trained workforce, we are destined for longstanding failure if we continue not to support programs that benefit the well being of our youngest vulnerable children and their families. It is time for us to become a voice for children, demanding not parity but priority in funding those who begin life at a tremendous disadvantage.\n\nCommunity Voices aims to encourage broad discussion on many topics of community interest.

      "title": "Hawaii ranks 24th in national rankings for child well-being",
      "publication": "KHON2",
      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (KHON2) - Here in Hawaii, we like to promote the well-being of our children.\n\nHow well do we stack up against the rest of the country?\n\nAccording to the 2018 Kids Count study Hawaii ranked 24th out of 50 states.\n   \nThe study looked at several factors like economy, health, family and community. \n     \nHowever, we got low marks for housing and education. \n\nThe 2018 KIDS COUNT Data Book was released Wednesday by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\n\nThe Data Book - which examines trends in child well-being across areas that represent what children need most to thrive - found that while there have been some gains on education measures, Hawaii still falls behind in the education domain, ranking 37th out of 50 states.\n\n\"Specifically graduation rates have improved and reading and math proficiency rates,\" said Ivette Rodriguez Stern, the Hawaii KIDS COUNT project director at the University of Hawaii Center on the Family. \"But our proficiency rates remain below the national average and the main ranking to us signals a need for greater investment in public education.\"\n\nHawaii did really well in health, since most of our kids have health insurance. \n\nWe had a low teen birth rate. \n\n\"Reading and math proficiency rates have seen improvements over the past decade,\" added Rodriguez Stern.\"But our proficiency rates are still below the national average and Hawaii has hovered in the bottom third in the country when it comes to education for a good part of the decade. This signals a need for greater investments in our public education if we're going to work toward greater improvements.\"\n\nLooking to address the lack of adequate funding for public education in Hawaii, the 2018 Hawaii State Legislature passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the state to tax investment property in order to increase funding for public education. \n\nWhile the majority of other states rely heavily on property taxes to fund public education, Hawaii currently funds it at the state level from the general fund.\n\nThe constitutional amendment will be put to Hawaii voters in the November ballot.\n\n\"As one of the lowest-rated school districts for spending per student, Hawai'i needs to find new ways to increase funding for education,\" said Deborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children's Action Network, which advocates for policies that support child well-being. \"If approved by voters, this amendment will provide an option to increase funding without increasing the tax burden on Hawaii residents. This additional funding for education can lead to better results in test scores, school completion, college attendance and job opportunities later in life for our keiki.\"\n\nThe annual Data Book uses 16 indicators to rank each state across four domains - education,\neconomic well-being, health and family and community. Findings in the other domains include:\n\n• Hawaii has seen improvement in almost all indicators of economic well-being over the\npost recession years, including the percentage of children in poverty, children whose\nparents lack secure employment, and children in households with a high housing cost\nburden. However, Hawai'i continues to have one of the worst housing cost burden rates\nin the nation, ranking 48th on the housing indicator, and ranking 30th in the economic\nwell-being domain.\n\n• Hawaii continues to do well in the health domain, ranking 13th in the nation. Hawai'i has\namong the smallest share of children without health insurance (2 percent), tying for\nsecond in the nation on this indicator.\n\n• Hawaii is also doing well in the area of family and community, ranking 12th in this\ndomain. There were no significant changes in the percentage of children in single-parent\nfamilies, in families where the household head lacks a high school diploma, and living in\nhigh-poverty areas over the past decade. However, following the national trend, the teen\nbirth rate in Hawai'i has continued its impressive decline and is down 42 percent from\n2010.\n\nThis year's Data Book also calls attention to the roughly 4.5 million young children in the United States who live in neighborhoods where there is a high risk of failing to count kids in the 2020 census. \n\nAn undercount of young children in the upcoming decennial census would short-change child well-being over the next decade by putting at risk hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding for programs that are critical to family stability and opportunity. Based on census data,\n\nHawaii receives more than $630 million annually in federal funding for programs that impact children.\n\n\"Roughly 39 percent of our young children under five are living in hard-to-count census tracts in Hawaii,\" said Barbara DeBaryshe, interim director of the Center on the Family. \"When kids aren't counted, state and local infrastructures face losing critical funding for programs like Head Start, child care subsidies, SNAP and school lunches.\"\n\nAn inaccurate 2020 census will also adversely affect research and advocacy efforts that use data to identify and analyze problems, document disparities, develop policy solutions and evaluate the efficacy of programs for years to come. \"We hope to partner with child advocates and other local stakeholders to explore ways of ensuring that all of Hawai'i's kids are counted,\" said Stern.\n\nThe Foundation offers the following recommendations to achieve a more accurate census:\n• maximize the U.S. Census Bureau's capacity by fully funding census outreach efforts\nand appointing a qualified and permanent director to lead the agency;\n• have state and local governments and community organizations invest in educational\noutreach to ensure the most vulnerable communities are counted;\n• broaden the circle of messengers (from child care providers to members of the clergy)\nand organizations (from public schools to libraries) who can provide outreach in their\ncommunities;\n• address the digital divide by providing all families online access either in local libraries\nor schools; and\n• address privacy and confidentiality concerns.\n\nThe 2018 KIDS COUNT Data Book will be available at www.aecf.org.\n\nAdditional information is available at www.aecf.org/databook, which also contains\nthe most recent national, state and local data on hundreds of indicators of child well-being.\n\nJournalists interested in creating maps, graphs and rankings in stories about the Data Book can\nuse the KIDS COUNT Data Center at datacenter.kidscount.org.\n\nAbout the University of Hawai'i Center on the Family\nThe University of Hawaii at Manoa serves approximately 20,000 students pursuing more than\n225 different degrees.

      "excerpt": "Sen. Karl Rhoads and Rep. John M. Mizuno, co-conveners of the Legislature’s Keiki Caucus, presented an aggressive 2019 Legislative Package of bills at the State Capitol today, relying on the support and input from dozens of organizations, individuals, and keiki themselves.\n\n“The future of our entire state depends on our keiki,” said Rep. Mizuno (Kalihi Valley, Kamehameha Heights, portion of Lower Kalihi). “This is our most promising, robust package of bills in the 25 years of the caucus.”\n\nSen. Rhoads (Dowsett Highlands, Pu‘unui, Nu‘uanu, Pacific Heights, Pauoa, Punchbowl, Palama, Liliha, Iwilei, Chinatown and Downtown) said the support and advice from Hawaiʻi’s many children’s advocacy groups is what makes this year’s package so important.\n\n“We depend on these groups and individuals that work with children to know the issues and what laws needs to be written,” Sen. Rhoads said. “With this package of bills, we hope not only to protect and support our keiki but also get them involved in the legislative process.”\n\nThe Keiki Caucus has introduced 19 House and Senate bills and five resolutions in its package.\n\nThe bills range from banning the sale of flavored tobacco products, to preventing bullying in schools, to creating and funding a pilot project for safe places for youth. Other bills deal with tax credits for households and dependent care services, creating child care centers, and developing mental health services including autism and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder training in schools.\n\nDeborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network, said keiki really need to be the top priority for lawmakers.\n\n“We have all worked to find the top priorities for our children,” Zysman said. “It is time to put these strong laws in place.”\n\nEstablished in 1994, the Keiki Caucus is a bipartisan group of House and Senate members joined by more than 100 community advocates including non-profits, educators, businesses, and parent groups to develop proposals and initiatives to benefit Hawai‘i’s youth.\n\nRepresentative John M.

      "excerpt": "For Immediate Release\n\nHONOLULU, March 17, 2020 — 94 local doctors and health professionals urged Governor David Ige to immediately take more decisive action to limit the spread of COVID-19, including closing all non-essential businesses and asking everyone to stay home.\n\n“Our Governor’s actions yesterday were a start, but not enough,” said Deborah Zysman, Executive Director of Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network. “Governor Ige must mandate extreme social distancing measures before the spread worsens.\n\nAccording to Jessica Yamauchi, Executive Director of the Hawaiʻi Public Health Institute, “Hawai‘i is fortunate to have a relatively small number of patients right now, but this number will continue to increase. We recently saw our first confirmed case of community spread; if we wait to act until the situation gets worse, it will be too late.” \n\nExtreme social distancing measures must be put in place before the spread worsens. The health and medical community’s recommendations include:\n\n \n\nFor families: Everyone should stay home. Travel and social events should be postponed  or canceled.\nFor workers and businesses: All non-essential businesses should be closed. All non-essential government employees should also be sent home. Only take-out should be allowed from restaurants; bars and other entertainment venues should close. Those who cannot go to work should be able to receive paid leave or Unemployment Insurance.\nFor visitors: Everyone entering the state should be screened. The state should develop protocols for those exhibiting symptoms and provide hand sanitizer to passengers. The same restrictions for local families should apply to visitors.\nFor the medical community: The state should ensure it has adequate facilities for those affected by COVID-19. Testing should be free and easier to access by waiving the requirement for a primary care physician order.\n \n\nMedia contact: Ryan Catalani, rcatalani@hawaii-can.org, (808) 531-5502 ext. 4\nHIPHI Executive Director Jessica Yamauchi and HCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman are available for press interviews.\n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children.

      "excerpt": "Deborah Zysmen, executive director of the Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN), emphasized the full scope of which households the inequities impact.\n\n“We’re talking about 60% of the population now. Again, we often have programs and services for our very low income families, but that’s not what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about most of us, our middle [wage] earners.”\n\nBased on their research, Hawaiʻi Appleseed and HCAN outlined target reform areas they believe will have the largest impact, including progressive taxation, increased cash flow, affordable housing, and early child care and education. \n\nOne way to increase cash flow for ALICE communities is through a payday loan reform bill that will take effect in January 2022. \n\nBefore the reform, individuals in Hawaiʻi seeking loans to help pay for rent and other necessities were paying 460% interest rates, with only two weeks to pay them back, according to Gabriel Kravitz, a consumer finance officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts. The reform bill clarified license requirements for lenders, extended payback periods, and put in place interest price caps, which reduced loan prices to a fraction of their original cost. ",

      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Highway Inn has 110 employees in its two locations, and about a half of them get paid when they're out sick.\n\n\"We do offer our paid time-off program to our full-time and not to our part-time staff,\" owner Monica Ryan said.\n\nThat could soon change.\n\nState lawmakers are considering a proposal that would require companies with 50 or more employees to offer paid sick time to full- and part-time food service workers.\n\nThe initiative is aimed at stopping the spread of illnesses.\n\nHawaii Children's Action Network Executive Director Debra Zysman said the mandate is long overdue. She estimates about 70 percent of low-wage workers have no sick leave.\n\n\"Families are in the workforce, both the mom and the dad. There's often a time when you need a day or two off because somebody's sick and you shouldn't be at work,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a measure moving through the Senate would allow workers to carry over up to 40 hours of sick time from year to year.\n\nThat's got Highway Inn's Ryan concerned. She fears the added expense would be another bite at the bottom line of eateries struggling to make a profit.\n\n\"The restaurant industry has dealt with the Hepatitis A outbreak last year,\" she said. \"We're also dealing with the current minimum wage increases. We're also dealing with increased healthcare costs.\"\n\nFour states require employers to pay employees for sick days.\n\nZysman doesn't think a Hawaii law would lead to abuses.\n\n\"You think about how many sick days people are taking, it's usually a couple days a year. We think the cost benefit pays off in our favor,\" she said.\n\nBut Ryan feels the number of people who'd benefit doesn't offset the expense, and the food service industry has a high rate of turnover.\n\n\"You're doing all this administrative work and the employee might not stay for you for more than a year,\" she said.",

Ed Case, (D - Hawaii), to fully support a social safety bill that is now the focus at the Capitol. \n\nThe fate of President Biden’s $1.75-trillion investment in social provisions and a climate policy package, known as the “Build Back Better” plan, rests with Congress. The Biden administration says this plan will help fund things like universal pre-k, extending a child tax credit, climate change provisions and more. \n\nThis legislation is something the Nature Conservancy and Hawaii’s Children’s Action Network Speaks hopes congress will pass.\n\n“Those are issues we are hearing are much needed from our families for years and we finally have an opportunity to make that a reality,” said Deborah Zysman with the Children’s Action Network Speaks.\n\nBut this children’s advocacy group is worried not all of Hawaii’s delegation is fully on board with this legislation.\n\n“Rep. Case has been saying he’s supportive yet his actions are saying he’s dragging his feet,” said Zysman. “He’s been the one questioning if it’s too much money…so we’re really calling on him because our community needs this.”",

      "excerpt": "Families First Coronavirus Response Act provisions have become available nationwide\n\nHONOLULU, April 2, 2020 — This week, many Hawaiʻi workers have access to paid sick time and paid emergency leave for the first time as the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act became effective.\n\nThe legislation, the second in a package of bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, was passed to provide support to workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See a summary below.\n\n“Emergency paid sick and paid family leave will help many working families to continue to meet their needs,” said Deborah Zysman, Executive Director of Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network. “This marks the first time Congress has passed paid time to care, a moment made possible by the groundbreaking work of our network and partners over the past 16 years.”\n\nThe bill was supplemented by the CARES Act, which offers enhanced unemployment insurance, strengthened nutrition security initiatives, and an increase in federal funds for Medicaid.\n\nHawaiʻi has no existing paid sick days nor a paid family leave program. Through Temporary Disability Insurance, a person could be eligible for leave with pay for their own care related to COVID-19, but not eligible to care for a family member who is ill, a child because of school closures, or because of quarantine orders.\n\nTo help residents cope with COVID-19, Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network is compiling local resources, including food, financial assistance, benefits, and keiki activities, at http://covid19.hawaii-can.org/.\n\nHCAN is also asking the public to call on the state legislature and Congress to fill the gaps in these response bills and make sure everyone can care for themselves or a loved one during the pandemic and beyond.\n\n“We worry about the people these programs leave out,” said Zysman. “All families deserve to be able to take time to care for themselves or their loved ones without becoming economically vulnerable.”\n\n \n\nAbout the Families First Coronavirus Response Act\n\nThis Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides eligible workers:\n\n10 paid sick days to deal with a diagnosis, illness, quarantine or school closing related to the virus.\nUp to three months of paid family and medical leave in the event of a closing of a child’s school or child care provider.\n \n\nMedia contact: Ryan Catalani\nrcatalani@hawaii-can.org\n(808) 531-5502 ext. 4\n\nMedia kit: Download high-resolution graphics about the new benefits and HCAN’s new website at bit.ly/hcan-covid-resources-media. \n\nHCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman is available for media interviews.\n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children.

      "title": "Constitutional Amendment Controversy",
      "publication": "KHON2",
      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (KHON2) - KHON2 partnered with Common Cause Hawaii Tuesday for a special live forum on the constitutional amendment, or con am, for an education surcharge. The forum was streamed live from the Box Jelly coworking space in Kakaako.\n\nVoters will decide in November whether to approve a constitutional amendment allowing for a property tax surcharge dedicated to school funding. The question will say:\n\n\"Shall the legislature be authorized to establish, as provided by law, a surcharge on investment real property to be used to support public education?\"\n\nIt has become a controversial and contentious issue. A panel of community leaders representing many sides of the issues shared their perspectives and engaged in a civil dialogue about the pros and cons of the con am.\n\nThe panelists are:\n\nCorey Rosenlee, president of the Hawaii State Teachers Association, in support.\nDeborah Zysman executive director of the Hawaii Children's Action Network, in support.\nColbert Matsumoto representing the Affordable Hawaii Coalition, opposing the amendment, and\nRandy Roth, professor emeritus at the Richardson School Of Law, opposing the amendment.\n1. This amendment has been called contentious, even confusing in its language. Each side represented here has firm beliefs in why to support or oppose it. Explain what this measure means exactly, and what the result of a yes vote and a no vote would mean.\n\n2. If this measure does not pass, how could the state provide more, better targeted, and school-designated funding for education?\n\n3. If this measure does pass, how can it be assured that the money raised would be added to the existing state budget amount for education, and not just considered a substitute source to pay toward the current general-fund amount schools get?\n\n4. If this measure does not pass, what other resources or efforts exist to stem the tide of teacher turnover and recruitment challenges that are often blamed on the high cost of living for educators?\n\n5. If this measure does pass, how specifically will it be determined and defined what types of properties will be taxed and at what amounts, and by when will this decision be made and be known to the voting public?\n\n6. If this measure does not pass, what else can be done to help guarantee more or better targeted spending to improve classrooms and facilities?\n\n7. The state has a history of redirecting and raiding special funds, and redefining who gets how much from a tax, even stretching sunsets well beyond their horizons. If the measure does pass, how can it be assured that the accrued money will be spent as intended toward public school education, and not redirected, raided, or redefined toward something tangentially education-related?\n\n8. Some big money and muscle are behind public awareness initiatives on both sides of this matter, among the groups represented here from the HSTA teachers union supporting and seeking YES votes, and the Affordable Hawaii Coalition opposing and seeking NO votes. Explain where each of your organizations gets their money and their grassroots support for its position and messaging.\n\n9. Counties have come out in strong opposition to this, even filing suit in a matter that the state Supreme Court will be taking up just two days from now on Thursday which could end up invalidating the measure on the ballot. If you were in the courtroom and had to plead a case to the justices, what would you say to try to convince them to keep the ballot measure active or to invalidate it as the counties seek?\n\n10. Another ballot measure up for vote is whether to hold a Constitutional Convention, where topics such as educational funding could also be addressed. State whether you advocate a yes or no vote on that, and explain why others should vote that way.\n\n11. In our KHON2 governor's debate last night, we asked Gov. David Ige, D, and his challenger Rep. Andria Tupola, R, several questions about this con am and asked for pledges on how they'd handle it if it passes and he or she is governor.\n\nGov. Ige said he supports the measure because:\n\nPublic education's needs exceed available funds,\nWe're the only state where no property tax helps schools; and\nHe feels it's a simple question for income and investment properties.\nHis pledge is to veto any measure that increases property tax for residents, or that does not guaranty revenue would be in addition to what's there and would be guaranteed to go to teachers students and classroom; none of the taxes would be on affordable rentals. He plans to monitor that by using the homeowner exemption to delineate who would be exempt.\nHe said the intent is to tax investment and income properties over $1 million, and he would add an exemption for affordable rentals.\nRep. Andria Tupola says she is against any tax hike, including this one because:\n\nThe con am's definition of investment properties ambiguous as to whether it could tax businesses and local rentals and ambiguous on what defines educational purpose with no guaranty it would go to salaries or the weighted student formula.\nShe said a whole new department could be required to administer the tax; and\nShe instead wants to audit the DOE on where it's spending now. \nTupola’s pledge if con am passes is to ensure the money goes to the weighted student formula or teacher salaries and no additional dollars to administration or the general fund.\nShe says defining what is a surchargeable property would have to start with the counties and make sure they are outside owners, not housing local families or local businesses.\nPlease respond to what the candidates for governor said as to the impact their pledges have on your position and arguments.\n\n12. Con am aside, whether this does or does not pass, what initiatives have or will you and the people or groups you represent today pledge to do to support sufficient and effective funding for Hawaii's public schools?\n\nCopyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

      "publication": "HPR",
      "excerpt": "\"Hawaiʻi already has at least four tax credits that working parents can access,\" said Nicole Woo, research and economic policy director at Hawaiʻi Children's Action Network.\n\n\"In a way, we do have child tax credits here in Hawaiʻi already. They're just called something different.\"\n\nAccording to Woo, families can take advantage of the following credits: food excise, childcare and dependent, low-income and renter's, and the recently expanded earned income tax credit.\n\n\"Last session, the state legislature improved the earned income tax credit here in Hawaiʻi,\" said Woo. \"It will be more effective in coming years. Specifically, it's going to allow lower income parents to get the full amount of the credit. So it's going to be even better targeted at those who really need the tax credit the most.\"\n\nWhile these credits help many local families, there are still challenges to address child poverty. According to Woo, one is getting state lawmakers to approve more spending toward credits. Another is raising the income eligibility requirements.\n\n\"One thing we've seen over the last 10 to 20 years, is that fewer families are able to get these tax credits at the state level, because they keep bumping up against the income eligibility limit,\" Woo said.\n\n\"A lot of those limits haven't been moved in a long time.\"\n\nAnother factor that impacts local families is the cost of living. Woo says this has been an ongoing crisis in the state, but the passage of an increased minimum wage in the last legislative session should help.\n\n\"The other side of the coin is how much people pay in taxes. So tax credits are just as important a tool to help working parents keep more money in their wallets,\" Woo said.\n\n\"This is often an overlooked tool for legislators.\"\n\nWoo tells HPR there may be a few lawmakers that may introduce a child tax credit proposal in the next session. While that could help families, she believes it may be better to combine current credits to make it easier for eligible families to receive.\n\nShe anticipates there will be more discussions on helping lower income workers and families at the next legislative session, which starts next year Jan. 18, 2022.",

We need immediate and long-term solutions to ensure the health and safety of our keiki, financial support for essential workers and the childcare industry that supports them.” \n\nIf child care providers start closing, the entire economy will be affected. Losing just 30% of available child care slots would result in losing approximately 1,300 jobs. Hawaiʻi was already experiencing a severe child care shortage; the state now stands to lose a significant share of its current capacity.\n\nThe child care community’s recommendations include:\n\nEnsuring child care for essential workers.\nContinuing federal funding for child care providers, even if children don’t attend due to COVID-19.\nOffsetting costs of child care for families impacted by COVID-19 and for essential workers.\nCreating a state grant program to ensure child care facilities can continue running for the next 6 months.\nAllowing temporary waivers so child care providers serving essential workers can increase capacity.\nEnsuring providers have needed sanitation equipment and supplies to operate safely.\nAllocating state and local funds for child care providers impacted by COVID-19.\n \n\nDownload the full letters to the Governor and four Mayors, list of 25 signatures, and logos at https://www.hawaii-can.org/covid19childcare.\n\n \n\nMedia Contact: Ryan Catalani\nrcatalani@hawaii-can.org\n(808) 531-5502 ext. 4\n\nHCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman and ECAS Lead Network Design and Innovation Kerrie Urosevich are available for press interviews.\n\n \n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children.

This despite the fact that the City has admitted “of course we know there aren’t enough shelter beds for all 2,400 unsheltered persons at one time.” This despite the fact that the 9th Circuit Court of appeals has said sweeps like these are unconstitutional, and the United States Supreme Court refused an invitation to disagree.\n\nWe never agree with these sweeps. But they are especially cruel during the holidays—particularly when we consider how many of the people affected are children. We want to get people into shelter. But as we said last year when the City swept the houseless population over the holidays, you don’t achieve that goal through unconstitutional sweeps in the middle of the night when shelters and services are limited. There is nothing compassionate about disrupting the lives of people who are already struggling to make ends meet in one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Government resources should be focused on building homes, not criminalizing poverty. If this is the best the City can do, its best is not good enough.\n\nWe call on the City to end this counterproductive, cruel, unconstitutional practice and focus its energies on community-based solutions to houselessness that are more effective, legally defensible, and more consistent with the culture of aloha in our island home.

      "excerpt": "Hawaiʻi children are falling behind—that's according to the latest Kids Count Data Book from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a report highlighting the well-being of children across the country.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall well-being of children in the state, Hawaiʻi dropped from 17 to 26 in the country in the last year.\n\nThe report, released Monday, assesses the well-being of children in the country, using information from the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of Education, and various nonprofit and local agencies. The foundation uses the data to measure four areas annually: education, health, economic well-being, and family and community.\n\nThe state's drop in overall rankings from above average to average in the 2021 report is concerning to child advocates. That's primarily because the latest report uses data from 2019—a time when the state's economy was booming.\n\n\"In the last Kids Count Data Book, we were 25th in the nation for economic well-being. So just about average for the nation,\" said Nicole Woo, director of research and economic policy at the Hawai‘i Children's Action Network. \"And then the 2021 data book that just came out—we've dropped to 44th in the nation.\"\n\nchildren school playground generic elementary\nSophia McCullough\nThe report measures four indicators to determine economic well-being. Among them are: child poverty, parental employment, housing costs, and school attendance and employment.\n\nWoo said the report specifically measures the number of households that spend more than 30% of their income on housing.\n\n\"We fell to 49th in the nation, with 38% of Hawaiʻi's children living in households that are housing cost-burdened,\" she said. \"And this is a reflection of the affordable housing crisis that we all know Hawai‘i has.\"\n\nWoo said because this report's findings are based on data from 2019, this indicator is likely to worsen when the eviction moratorium expires—and when researchers analyze data from 2020.\n\nAnother indicator where the state plunged was the number of teens, aged 16 to 19, not attending school and not working. Woo said the state ranked 47th in the country, with 10% of teens in this category. She believes this indicator is also likely to worsen next year due to the pandemic.",

      "publication": "HPR",
      "excerpt": "State lawmakers are considering several measures to improve early education in the islands. Two bills could help address an ongoing shortage of early educators.\n\nWhen it comes to early education in the state, historically there have not been enough programs to meet demand from families. And the pandemic has worsened that shortage.\n\n\"We’re not seeing any additional child care be created at this time. We’ve only seen a loss of seats, we have not seen adding any seats. So it erodes the total number of child care space and availability. So the market is getting more rough for parents to find care, but the desire for care has not changed,\" said Kathleen Algire, the director of early education for the advocacy group Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network.\n\nA contributing factor to this shortage is the lack of child care professionals.\n\nAlgire says child care is extremely labor-intensive, and the ratio of adults to children varies by age group and setting.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services licenses child care providers and has detailed administrative rules. For example, in a licensed preschool, there must be one staff member for eight 2-year-olds.\n\nFor a 3-year-old class, there can be one adult for 12 kids.\n\n\"Just to serve the children that need care, you’re going to need a lot of people in that workforce and labor is expensive. We haven’t done a great job though of actually making any kinds of investments in it either – at the state level, federal, county – we have not done that in a significant way. And so what we’ve seen over time is people leaving the workforce in early care and learning because it pays poverty-level wages,\" Algire told Hawaiʻi Public Radio.\n\nAlgire says compensation is the biggest reason people leave early child care.",

      "publication": "Pacific Business News",
      "excerpt": "Pacific Business News talked story with Deborah Zysman, executive director, and Ryan Catalani, director of advancement, of Hawaii Children Action Network, a local nonprofit focused on children and families, to learn more about what they do and the trends and challenges they’ve seen emerge in the nonprofit sector.\n\nTell us more about your organization. We call ourselves a movement — fighting for keiki and their families. For 20 years, we’ve advocated laws that keep our children safe, healthy and ready to learn. So we’re not a direct-service organization, but much more of a movement. We constantly ask the question: How do we make Hawaii the best place to raise a family? Some areas we focus on are child care and pre-school, paid family leave, livable wage, children’s oral health care and trauma, abuse and neglect.\n\nWhat is your model for fundraising? Our operating budget is under one million dollars. Our model for fundraising mostly comes from soft money, or contributions/philanthropic money, and some government contracts. We were also a one of Aloha United Way’s 10 ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed grant recipient organizations. [Its ALICE Policy Hui program was awarded $150,000 toward developing a common advocacy and policy agenda to advance laws and policies that support ALICE) interests.] We’ve become less dependent on grants and have found that growing more of our advocacy and lobbying work has produced interest from individual donors. We’re not running a social enterprise here and are not doing a government service.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced in your line of work? One challenge is getting and keeping quality employees. The need for child care workers is so great, but the pay has been stagnant over the years. We don’t want to charge families more for child care, so one workaround is a type of infusion from a broader business community — that, or we need more government money. Government funding has flatlined, so pay hasn’t increased.\n\nSomething else I’ve noticed is how Hawaii is full of small nonprofits, and we should look to merge and consolidate services more. There’s this societal idea that if you have a good idea, you should start a small business or nonprofit. Truth of the matter is, nonprofits are more regulated than for-profits, we just get a bit of a tax break.\n\nWhat trends have you noticed? One trend we’ve noticed is millennials not giving as much to nonprofits as [that age group] did in the ’70s. One way we’re looking at combatting this is by encouraging more volunteer advocates and community outreach, because they are looking to get involved, but just don’t have the funds to support. Social media is also evolving. We have a big following on Facebook, and the feedback we’ve received says people are looking for more of a personal, face-to-face presence. We’re trying to get out in the community more.\n\nWhat are your goals? We will be setting our new policy agenda later this year and hope to continue building this grassroots movement. We are excited to be taking our Parent Leadership Training Institute Hawaii to Maui to help anyone with a passion for children issues, regardless of if they are a parent themselves or not. We want to continue fighting for access to affordable child care and housing, paid family leave, school issues.",

      "publication": "Hawaii Business Magazine",
      "excerpt": "Deborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network, argues regular, full-time grandparent-provided child care is a model of the past – from when women were at home and when people didn’t have to continue working into their 60s and 70s. Today, the Honolulu-based nonprofit tends to hear from families that grandparents help in bits and pieces, not all the time.\n\n“They assist with things like picking up kids on occasion, but in terms of are they the ones watching children everyday while parents are at work? That model for most families is no more. … But part of the problem we have is people think it still is. People think, ‘Oh grandparents are doing it all,’ but Grandma is working. Grandma does not have time to stay home full time anymore and take care of the children.”\n\nThe Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network leads a group of nonprofits, unions, community advocates and academics under the Hawai‘i Working Families Coalition. During the 2021 legislative session, the coalition supported several efforts, including a family leave insurance program, an increase in the minimum wage, changes to the state’s Kupuna Caregivers Program to make it more flexible, mandatory paid sick leave for employees, and more help for early childhood education.\n\n“People don’t have choices they used to have … so I think that’s the issue,” she says. If a family wants to have a parent stay home with a young child, they need to be economically able to do so, she adds, “which is where we need policies like paid family leave or things like universal basic income or increasing wages so families can live on one earner.”",

Children need well-child and dental visits, including screenings, dental checkups, and vaccinations. Regular checkups not only track development, but also identify any health problems earlier to avoid complications and more costly treatment.\n\n“Many parents and caregivers are concerned about exposing their infants, young children and even themselves to COVID-19,” said Charlene Robles, supervisor of DOH’s Early Intervention Section. “The well-child visits campaign provides parents and caregivers with visual information about how doctors are creating a safe environment for their patients.”\n\nThe campaign includes a television ad featuring a local family and local pediatricians, highlighting the safety and importance of in-person doctor office visits. The campaign also includes radio and digital ads, which run through early next year.\n\n“We want families and children see their primary care clinicians. The well-child visit is an opportunity to assess health issues that may not have been addressed because of the pandemic,” said Jeffrey Okamoto, M.D., vice president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Hawaii Chapter. “We especially find that families appreciate the value of routine visits which sometimes lead to treatment for health conditions or detection of important issues such as hearing or vision problems.”\n\nThe AAP Hawaii Chapter, Hawaiʻi Department of Human Services, Your ʻOhana, and Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network partnered with DOH to inform the public on this important recommendation.

      "excerpt": "Executive director of the Hawaii Children’s Action Network lobbies for children in need\nHonolulu Star Advertiser\n\nBy Vicki Viotti, July 28, 2017\n\nThe Merchant Street office occupied by Deborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children’s Action Network, is a long way from places most frequented by children. But the state Capitol is a short walk away, and being close to the wheels of government is a good thing for any group with the pursuit of kids’ interest as its mission.\n\nZysman, 41, acknowledges that the last legislative session was no barn-burner, rating the earned-income tax credit as the biggest help to family and child welfare. But she also cites a somewhat bureaucratic-sounding change — the addition of staff and governance provisions to the Office of Early Childhood — as a win.\n\nHaving that office staffed properly will enable grants to be administered and initiatives such as the expansion of preschool access to become reality, she said.\n\n“It’s not particularly sexy from a media standpoint but without that foundational piece, we couldn’t do all these other programs” such as expanding access to preschool, Zysman added.\n\nThe advocacy organization is currently focusing on building coalitions among various nonprofits and experts, and training parents to be advocates, too. The Buffalo, N.Y., native holds a master’s in public health but is schooled further as a mother (she and husband Dan Gluck, who directs the state Ethics Commission, have two children).\n\nStill, it’s the volunteer voices of ordinary parents that really resonate with lawmakers, she said.\n\nThe nonprofit network (www.hawaii-can.org), now with a staff of four full-timers and two part-timers, was founded in 2000 as the Good Beginnings Parnership for Hawai‘i’s Keiki. Two years later as the Good Beginnings Alliance it became a founding member of the P-20 Initiative, fostering education improvements from preschool through college years.\n\nSince then they’ve lobbied for various family supports, such as Healthy Start, providing support to new parents. Keeping such programs fiscally afloat has been a challenge, she said.\n\n“Often prevention programs, child and family programs, are the first things to go and the last things to come back,” Zysman said. “From the hospital they would triage families with risk factors. It was cut dramatically back … and it has never made a comeback.”\n\nQuestion: How do you view the state of children in Hawaii? Are the economic problems here keeping them from doing as well as they should?\n\nAnswer: That’s a wide question.… Hawaii’s in this interesting place, as I kind of look at it. We say we value kids and families a lot. We talk the talk about it.\n\nHowever, I think some of our actual structures and programs, we’re way behind where some other states are, including even Republican states. Sometimes I think it’s perhaps fiscal.\n\nQ: What programs would other states have that we don’t?\n\nA: Like building out universal preschool, for example. Subsidizing high-quality child care, looking more holistically at wraparound services, prenatal substance abuse services, programs for at-risk families and children.\n\nI think we used to be very progressive. We used to have this Healthy Start Program, which was considered the gold standard across the nation. Hawaii’s still looked at as very progressive, but in many ways we’re not doing the progressive stuff that we used to. The Healthy Start program was really cut in the recession….\n\nQ: How would you rate progress toward the universal preschool goal?\n\nA: Hawaii has been progressing in a slow but steady expansion of public (Department of Education and charter) preschool for our 4-year-olds. Presently, we are serving about 500 of the 16,000 4-year-olds each year.\n\nThis past session, the state Legislature voted to expand our public DOE-based pre-K program by five classrooms in the 2018-2019 school year. Hawaii’s program has been recognized as one that is very high in quality; however we are still serving very few children. …\n\nI believe that given our limited resources, it is more important to prioritize quality services for low-income children from birth up to kindergarten rather than putting all our resources into creating another grade within public schools for children of all income brackets.\n\nQ: What, if anything, worries you about the federal budget planning, where children are concerned?\n\nA: So much is still unknown regarding the federal budget and where things will end up. But I have many concerns about the current proposals on the table.\n\nThe president’s budget proposal puts children and low- and moderate-income families in the crosshairs of $1.7 trillion in cuts to programs that help reduce poverty and support working families.\n\nThe proposals, if enacted, would harm Hawaii’s future. It would mean many more of Hawaii’s children would be sick, hungry, and struggling in school.…\n\nBoth the president and Congress have proposed deep cuts to Medicaid funding, jeopardizing health insurance and access to regular medical care for the 149,500 children insured through Medicaid in Hawaii. In Hawaii, 4,600 babies a year, or 1 out of 4, receive health care through Medicaid at their birth.\n\nThere are also proposals to cut funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program; today, approximately 26,000 children in Hawaii get their health insurance through CHIP.…\n\nThere are also proposals to cut funding for the SNAP program (formerly food stamps) by about a quarter. One proposed changes includes requiring states to pay some of the cost of SNAP benefits; it would let states reduce their costs (and federal government costs) by giving states the options of changing eligibility provisions so that fewer kids will receive SNAP, and lowering SNAP benefits. …\n\nThere are some bright spots in the federal proposals such as a possible paid family leave program for new parents, and several concepts for greater childcare tax credits or funding.\n\nQ: Do you think Hawaii’s relatively generous health-care system is secure or threatened in the midst of the federal debate on reform?\n\nA: Threatened. People in Hawaii are fortunate to have the Prepaid Health Care Act and many will continue to have coverage regardless of the federal debate. However, cuts to Medicaid could be a serious blow to our state, especially to the thousands of babies and children who are currently covered.\n\nQ: How do you see Hawaii’s standing in the fight against child abuse?\n\nA: The most effective way to prevent child abuse is to invest in programs that build strong and supported families. Cases of child abuse and neglect continue to be highest among children birth to 5, and we know that child abuse and neglect is often intergenerational.\n\n“Risk factors” for abuse and neglect include substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental health issues and poverty. These problems have increased over recent years, without increases in availability of treatment resources to address these.\n\nThere are many strategies that Hawaii should consider: offering paid family leave so that parents with new babies can afford to stay home and bond with an infant, investment in family support programs such as Tutu and Me, Keiki Steps and Family Hui and investment in substance abuse, domestic violence and mental health.\n\nQ: Where is Hawaii’s social safety net for children strongest, and where is it weakest?\n\nA: Family and ‘ohana are such core elements of our community. We are fortunate that so many of our families have multi-generational, interconnected webs of support. It truly does “take a village to raise a child” and children thrive when they have safe and supported families that can meet their needs.\n\nHowever, many of our families are struggling. Some are isolated without close friends or family to help out. Others are facing health or employment challenges. Many families are dealing with the high cost of living and struggling to keep food on the table and pay the rent.\n\nAs a community we have an obligation to create that social support web for all our families; to fill gaps and ensure that our children have every opportunity to be safe, healthy and able to succeed in school.",

      "publication": "HPR",
      "excerpt": "State lawmakers are on the verge of passing legislation for paid family leave in Hawai’i. If passed by the House and Senate, the governor is expected to sign the measure into law. HPR’s Wayne Yoshioka has this update on what it could mean for Hawai’i workers.\n\nAs currently proposed, the state would enact paid family leave for all Hawai’i workers in 2020 with the first payout made in 2022.  Hawai’i Working Families Coalition member, Deborah Zysman, says paid family leave has been discussed for at least a decade in Hawai’i and, for the first time, it’s being advanced beyond the conceptual stage.\n\n“We are talking about maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption of a new child or any kind of family caretaking.  So if you have a very ill child – not like the cold or the flu – but a hospitalized child, a spouse or immediate family member that needs caretaking, which I think is a growing problem that we have.\n\nZysman, who is also the executive director of the Children’s Action Network, says the current model being proposed is a social insurance program paid into by workers.  The cost per worker would be one dollar a week or 57 dollars a year and will provide qualifying individuals up to 16 weeks of partial pay.  House Labor and Public Employment Committee chair, Aaron Ling Johanson, says the final decisions on structuring the program would be made by a paid family leave implementation board.\n\n“The method of approaching how to do that is through an implementation board that brings together the various sectors that are important constituencies.  So, small business, the departments, paid family leave advocates, the insurance industry and several others to pick the model that might work best for Hawai’i.”\n\nJohanson, says paid family leave would be available only for qualified Hawai’i workers, and would not be an entitlement or public assistance program.   Senator Karl Rhoads, a strong supporter of the proposals, says there are numerous program models to follow.\n\n“The rest of the world is way ahead of us in this.  There’s only 3 countries in the world that really don’t have any paid family leave.  One of them is Swaziland, one of them is Papua New Guinea and the third one is the United States.  Everyone else has it.  Obviously, the same concerns are relevant in other countries and they’ve figured out a way to get around it and also manage to make business work.”\n\nThe States of California, Rhode Island, Washington, New Jersey and New York have insurance-based paid family leave.   Working Families Coalition member, Zysman, says paid family leave will help Hawai’i workers with local families or families on the mainland and provide enough money for food and rent.\n\n“We know that in Hawai’i, so many families live paycheck to paycheck.  And what happens is, you have this kind of medical event in your family.  A new baby in the home or a sick family member and that’s actually the triggering event that forces people into poverty.”\n\nThe House version of the bill will be voted on by members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee Tuesday.

      "excerpt": "NINETY PERCENT OF a child’s brain is developed by age 5, so it’s critical that every child have access to high-quality child care and early learning programs, according to the nonprofit Hawaii Children’s Action Network. Of course, that’s not everything they need. “All children should have a safe place to sleep, food in their stomachs, access to care and a family that can support them,” says HCAN executive director Deborah Zysman. “But we’re not there yet. “Child care in Hawaii is about a third of the average family’s income. Half of our kids are starting kindergarten with no preschool. Even though we have good health care access compared to some other states, a lot of our low-income kids still don’t have access to medical and dental care. About 25 percent of Hawaii’s kids are considered food-insecure,” Zysman says.\n\nThe Manoa resident, with two young children herself, has a master’s in public health from the University of North Carolina. She and her husband moved here in 2003.\n\nThe nonprofit was founded as the Good Beginnings Alliance in 1996 by an act of the state Legislature. Zysman was hired as executive director in 2012 to help it transition from a “quasi-governmental,” direct-services office to its current status as an independent nonprofit advocacy agency. In 2015, it changed its name to Hawaii Children’s Action Network to reflect the new focus.\n\n“I have a passion for community health, community organizing, bringing people together to work on root causes,” explains Zysman. “HCAN now does ‘movementbuilding’ – we work on a ‘super-hero’ theme to champion kid’s issues – with partner agencies, the business community, lawmakers and we’re doing a lot more work with families in terms of leadership training and family strengthening.”\n\nTo determine what issues are key for children, the nonprofit analyzes data and best practices from across the nation and the world. “Last fall, we convened a children’s policy agenda at the Church of the Crossroads with about 80 people from throughout the state, to determine where the gaps are in direct services. Then we discuss what action might be taken. “This past legislative session, we were able to get an additional $4 million in funding for preschool subsidies for about 1,200 low-income children through the Department of Human Services.”\n\nHCAN has about 5,000 individuals in its advocacy network. “Lawmakers need to hear from real people in the community about what will make things better for kids. And we try to be the bridge for that.” hawaii-can.org N Each month, Hawaii Business profiles small and medium nonprofits that deserve more recognition.",

      "publication": "Civil Beat",
      "excerpt": "Nicole Woo remembers working part-time jobs as a waitress and bartender, and how she was more likely to work while sick because she couldn’t afford to take a day off.\n\nNow she’s an advocate at the nonprofit Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, working to convince lawmakers to pass a bill requiring employers to provide paid sick leave.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers are negotiating a final version of  House Bill 4, along with House Bill 213, that would expand the state’s unpaid family leave law. But neither proponents or opponents are happy about the latest drafts of either bill.\n\nHB 4 would allow workers to accrue up to five days of sick leave each year. There’s an exception for smaller companies and those that have more generous policies.\n\nHB 213 would allow employees at large companies to take four weeks of unpaid leave to take care of sick siblings or after the death of a close family member. The current law lets workers take off time to care for sick children, spouses and parents.\n\nDeborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children’s Action Network, said HB 4 started out strong, but has been watered down so much that if it passes, Hawaii could have the weakest mandatory sick leave law in the nation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce and the Hawaii Restaurants Association have been raising alarms about how even the weaker versions of the bill could harm the ability for small businesses to make a profit.\n\nDavid Schell, the general manager for Island Princess Macadamia, submitted written testimony saying mandating that the company provide sick leave to its 60 employees would be damaging.\n\n“This notion is ludicrous,” wrote Schell. “It penalizes those who remain healthy and come to work.\n\nBoth the sick leave and the family leave proposals will be heard in negotiating committees on Wednesday, but until then, advocates and opponents are being kept in the dark as legislators work on the bills behind closed doors. Lawmakers are in the midst of conference committee, a period at the end of the session when they no longer hear public testimony on bills and work out the details among themselves.\n\n“We just have to wait,” said Catherine Betts, who leads the Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women and has been advocating for paid sick leave and family leave. She commented that “conference is just not the most transparent way of doing government.”\n“It’s very confusing that a lot of things have been blanked out,” said Lauren Zirbel, a lobbyist for the Hawaii Food Industry Association. “So we’re not really sure what is happening.”\n\nWeakening The Sick Leave Bill\nWhen House Rep. Roy Takumi introduced HB 4, he sought to give workers the right to sick leave after working for 80 hours. They could start taking sick days on the 19th day of their employment.\n\nBoth the House and Senate amended the bill and the latest version said workers must complete 680 hours before they have a right to sick leave. That’s the equivalent of 17 weeks, or more than four months.\n\nThe drafts that passed the House and Senate said workers wouldn’t be able to use the sick leave until they finished 750 hours of work, or the equivalent of nearly 19 weeks.\n\nThe original draft of HB 4 was stronger. It provided workers with one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked, or at total of seven days each year, for all workers.\n\nThe versions eventually passed by the House and Senate said that workers accrue one hour of sick leave for every 40 hours worked, five days each year, unless the employer provides a higher limit.\n\nThose drafts also exempted employers that have a relatively small number of workers or pay their workers a certain amount higher than minimum wage, without specifying how many employees or how far above minimum wage.\n\nThe amended versions also stripped a provision that described how the sick leave law would be enforced.\n\nBetts said that she’s concerned by efforts to narrow the law’s applicability. “If the true goal of this bill is to protect public health then the minimum wage provision really doesn’t have a place in public policy,” she said.\n\nZysman is worried that putting a weak law on the books will lessen lawmakers’ incentive to pass a stronger bill next year.\n\n“I think those blanks are what have everyone a little on edge,” she said.\n\nWoo from the Appleseed Center, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said that she’s worried the bill will do little to help people working multiple part-time jobs who might take many months to reach the 750-hour mark.\n\nShe’s also concerned that if the state sets a low standard for sick leave, employers could actually worsen their current sick leave policies in response.\n\nConcerns About Family Leave\nAdvocates have similar concerns about Rep. Aaron Johanson’s bill, HB 213, to expand the state’s unpaid family leave law. That measure would allow workers in companies with more than 100 employees to take four weeks off without pay to care for a sibling with a serious illness or following the death of a close family member.\n\nUnder current law, workers are allowed four weeks of family leave for the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a sick child, spouse or parent.\n\nThat proposal didn’t receive as much critical testimony as the sick leave bill\n\nStill, Zirbel from the Hawaii Food Industry Association said that the bill would raise costs for grocers.\n\n“Please keep in mind that profit margins are already quite sparse for grocers, which generally operate at a profit margin of around one percent,” she wrote in testimony. “Hawaii’s food prices can be up to seventy percent more than the national average and any additional costs will drive up grocery prices, punish low-income consumers and burden businesses.”\n\nAs with the sick leave bill, advocates of expanding family leave say that the bill doesn’t go far enough.\n\nZysman said the standard for family leave in many other states is a minimum of 12 weeks off with partial pay, with the percentage of pay decreasing as your income goes up.\n\nBetts said that her office has been using a federal grant to study the issue and is expected to come up with recommendations by September. Like Zysman, she doesn’t think Johanson’s bill is strong enough, since it doesn’t include paid maternity and paternity leave.\n\n“I think the question is in reality how many people can this actually protect,” she said. “I mean really, in Hawaii how many people can take unpaid leave? But I think it’s a step in the right direction.”\n\nShe said whether or not the bill passes, she expects to be back at the Legislature next year to advocate for the recommendations expected to emerge from her office’s analysis.\n\nWhy Businesses Are Worried\nBut many business owners believe the existing proposals already go too far.\n\nThe General Contractors Association of Hawaii testified the proposals would add a new layer of complexity to existing employee benefits, while other business lobbyists argued the bills shouldn’t apply to part-time workers.\n\nThe bottom line for business opponents is how these measures would increase the cost of doing business in Hawaii, which is already a very expensive place to operate. A variety of industries from construction to credit unions are opposed to expanded sick and family leave.\n\nDirk Koeppenkastrop, the owner of Il Gelato, which has 45 employees and has been hoping to expand, said that the bill would drive up the cost of gelato.\n\n“With the proposed bill and ongoing increasing minimum wage our gelato cost would go to up to $4.50,” he said. “Would you buy a scoop of gelato for $4.50? We cannot increase our scoop prices, as we would lose our local customers.”\n\nBut advocates for paid sick leave and family leave point to studies showing such policies improve employee loyalty and productivity.\n\n“It’s a long time overdue but I’m hopeful that Hawaii can prove it’s a progressive state for families,” Betts said.",

      "excerpt": "HONOLULU, February 28, 2020 — Three community leaders who have transformed the lives of Hawaiʻi’s children and families will be recognized with the inaugural Champions for Children awards.\n\nAl Castle, Kū Kahakalau, and Calvin Sia were selected by Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network to receive the first-ever Champions for Children awards, which will be presented at a dinner ceremony on March 12, 2020.\n\n\n\nAl Castle was educated at Punahou and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Colorado State University. Mr. Castle was also trained at the University of New Mexico, the University of Virginia and Columbia University. He has written over 60 scholarly articles and three books. He spent 35 years as a college professor and university administrator, mainly on the mainland. For the past 23 years, Mr. Castle served as Executive Director of the Samuel N. and Mary Castle Foundation, one of America’s oldest family foundations. As such, he has led numerous initiatives on behalf of public and private preschools throughout the state. He is an avid promoter of high-quality early education and is responsible for bringing a variety of innovative teacher training opportunities to Hawaii. Mr. Castle is also a trustee of the Pettus Foundation in Saint Louis, Missouri, Colorado’s Martha S. Trimble Trust, and the Early Childhood Funders Collaborative in Washington, DC.\n\n“The Samuel N. and Mary Castle Foundation, with 180 years in Hawaii, has long served Hawaii’s early education. It is my great pleasure to work with HCAN to continue our additional work as an advocate for Hawaii’s keiki and to create a high-quality, accessible public-private early educational system,” said Castle.\n\nKū Kahakalau is the founder and former director of Kanu O Ka ʻĀina, the first Hawaiian-focused public charter school, located on Hawaiʻi Island. An award-winning educator, researcher, songwriter and Hawaiian language and culture expert, Dr. Kahakalau has been involved in indigenous, particularly Hawaiian, education and research for over 30 years. Her work has promoted the revitalization of Hawaiian language and culture, hands-on learning in the environment, community sustainability, food sovereignty, and Hawaiian self-determination in education and beyond using a Pedagogy of Aloha.\n\n“When we immerse learners in an atmosphere of aloha and respect, when we engage them in authentic learning, solving real-world problems in our communities and make them understand their responsibilities as island residents and global citizens, education becomes relevant, it becomes real, exciting – and world-class, and to top it off, education becomes fun – as it should be!” said Dr. Kahakalau.\n\nCalvin Sia​ is a pediatrician and lifelong advocate for children in Hawai’i and across the world. He started innovative programs in Hawaiʻi that have been adopted nationally and internationally. Among the many accomplishments, Dr. Sia revolutionized the quality of medical care for children by creating the concept of Family-Centered Medical Home with home visiting programs to prevent child abuse and neglect as part of this system of care. In addition, he co-founded Hawaii’s Zero to Three Program, a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center and Variety School for Learning Disabilities. He is still active in the community and is a Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Hawai’i John A. Burns School of Medicine.\n\n“Let's take action now to help Hawaiʻi’s young children achieve their physical, mental, and social potential. Early learning begins in the critical first three years of life,” said Dr. Sia.\n\nThe awards will be presented at the Champions for Children dinner on March 12, 2020, from 5:30 – 8:30 pm. The event will be held at Mariposa at Neiman Marcus Ala Moana.\n\n“Mr. Castle, Dr. Kahakalau, and Dr. Sia are amazing individuals who each have done so much for our keiki. We’re excited to honor them with our first ever Champions for Children awards,” said Deborah Zysman, Executive Director of Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network.\n\nProceeds from the dinner will benefit Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network. The public is invited to join the celebration by purchasing a ticket at www.hawaii-can.org/champions2020.\n\nThe event is supported by presenting sponsor Kamehameha Schools and sponsors Nakpuna Foundation/Na Alii Consulting & Sales, AlohaCare, Hawaiian Airlines, HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union, Kapiolani Medical Center, KCAA, and Locations Hawaiʻi.",

      "excerpt": "Funders institute strict monitoring systems to ensure their funds are used for the purpose for which they were awarded. Those nonprofits doing government work are subject to extreme vetting via numerous performance assessments and program and financial audits throughout the contract term.\n\nCayetano urges supporters to discern where their funding goes. Nonprofits seek donations to fill the gaps left by other funding streams that make it hard to ensure quality services and to recruit and retain staff.\n\nIn many cases, funders will not support salaries and overhead, forcing nonprofits to do critical and mandated work at sub-cost levels that don’t capture their true costs. Nonprofits are resourceful and innovative, leveraging relationships, private funds and the power of their mission to generate necessary funding, making them reliable and resilient partners.\n\nIs there room for improvement? Absolutely!\n\nWe agree wholeheartedly with Cayetano that we all should be held accountable to the highest of standards, and there is no doubt we all can strive for higher achievement. Constant evaluation is necessary to assess quality and to ensure the right approaches are being employed to address the mission. In turn, we encourage our supporters to fund the overhead and other administrative costs, quality control, R&D and other critical investments that will support our community-based organizations to be the reliable, innovative and cutting edge entities that Vicky Cayetano envisions.\n\nHANO is a member of the True Cost Coalition which works to get all true costs covered in government and private contracts and grants, for quality service delivery and a stronger, more resilient Hawaii.",

First of all, we are rallying to expand public preschool both in the Executive Office of Early Learning and within the Charter Schools. So, we’ve got some growing programs in public preschool for our 4 year-olds and we wanna see those continue to grow.  The second thing we are rallying behind are some bills to expand what’s called the child and dependent care tax credit.  So, from our middle-income families who are paying for child care out-of-pocket, giving them a bigger tax refunds when they pay their state taxes in April.  So they get money back and right now, there’s a very small tax credit.  We wanna see it much larger and closer to the actual cost of child care.”\n\nEarly Childhood Day is an annual event during the legislative session.",

      "excerpt": "Released to coincide with National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (Oct. 25 – 31)\n\nHONOLULU, October 26, 2020 — Thousands of kids in Hawaiʻi may be suffering from the harmful effects of lead poisoning. A new report, released today by the nonprofit Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network, shows how the state can prevent this.\n\n“Childhood lead poisoning is a completely preventable health threat,” said Deborah Zysman, Executive Director of Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network. “With universal childhood testing and the recommendations outlined in the report, we can protect children and the larger community from the life-altering effects of lead poisoning.”\n\nThere is no safe level of lead in the body, but about 1% of Hawaiʻi children ages 1 and 2 showed elevated blood lead levels, according to the report. Further, only about a quarter of kids in Hawaiʻi are even tested, so the actual rate of lead poisoning is still unknown. Even low levels of lead exposure can have severe long-term consequences that follow children into adulthood.\n\nHCAN’s report recommends increasing public education, requiring all children to be tested, increasing inspections of houses and other possible lead sources, and expanding funding for lead poisoning prevention. These recommendations are based on perspectives from pediatricians, toxicologists, public health professionals, and environmental emergency response professionals.\n\n“This is a matter of health equity and justice,” said Zysman. “Although lead poisoning can affect any family, some keiki are more at risk, including low-income families, recent immigrants and refugees, and those who live in homes built before 1978. As a state, we have an obligation to ensure our most vulnerable children and communities can lead healthy lives.”\n\n \n\nContact: Ryan Catalani\nrcatalani@hawaii-can.org\n(808) 531-5502 ext. 4\n\nDownload the report: https://www.hawaii-can.org/childhood_lead_poisoning_prevention\nEducational materials for families are also available at that link, courtesy of the Hawaiʻi Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program.\n\nHCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman is available for press interviews.\n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children. Its grassroots movement strives to ensure that all keiki are safe, healthy, and ready to learn. For more information, visit http://www.hawaii-can.org.",

      "title": "Column: Working families deserve permanent earned income tax refund\n",
      "publication": "Star Advertiser",
      "excerpt": "Hawaii’s low-income and working-class families are still struggling to afford the cost of basic necessities like rent, groceries and transportation. This year, state lawmakers have the opportunity to reduce the tax burden for the workers who need it the most — giving them a much-needed lifeline amid rising costs and the continuing pandemic.\n\nJan. 28 is national Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day, and a good time to reflect on how the state can boost tax refunds for workers with the lowest incomes.\n\nLegislators should make the state tax refund for working families with low incomes permanent, and expand it so that those earning the lowest wages can access its full value. This would be a great first step toward reducing the tax burden on hardworking families. Smart policy choices like this would prioritize resources for families with low incomes to help them — and our economy — move beyond this pandemic.\n\nMaking this change to our tax code is more important now than ever. Hawaii’s cost of living is the highest in the nation and it has only increased due to economic fallout from the pandemic. Despite rising costs for working families, wages haven’t kept pace with Hawaii’s soaring costs for housing, food, transportation and health care.\n\nHawaii first introduced its tax refund for working families — known as the Earned Income Tax Credit or EITC — in 2017. However, it is scheduled to expire at the end of 2022, and the current structure of the credit leaves households with the lowest incomes — those earning below $15,000 — unable to take full advantage of it despite having the greatest need.\n\nIt’s a matter of basic fairness. Hawaii’s lowest-income earners pay an average of 15% of their incomes in state and local taxes — an effective tax rate two-thirds higher than close to double what the richest 1% of Hawaii residents pay.\n\nConsequently, the tax code also disadvantages Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander residents, who face barriers to high wage jobs as a result of the ongoing impacts of colonialism. For many people of color and residents with low incomes in Hawaii, these pre-pandemic economic and tax inequities have only deepened after two long years of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe expansion of this important tax credit will not only increase tax fairness, it will also have a tangible economic impact on families and their communities. For every dollar returned via tax refund as part of an EITC, up to $1.24 is spent in the local economy.\n\nThe EITC is a proven tax and economic policy that has helped working families make ends meet while also strengthening their communities and local economies. Federal and state versions of the credit have existed for decades and are available in 30 states (plus D.C. and Puerto Rico).\n\nOf the 32 nonfederal credits, 27 are refundable and — as a result — fully accessible to working families with the lowest incomes. Hawaii is 1 of only 5 states with an EITC that does not make its credit refundable.\n\nHawaii’s tax credit for working families has already given invaluable financial relief to thousands of households and injected millions of dollars into the local economy.\n\nBy ensuring that all working families with low incomes — especially those paid the least — are able to permanently access the full value of this credit, we can ensure that communities across our state are stronger and better prepared for the many challenges that lay ahead in the 21st century.\n\n",

      "publication": "",
      "excerpt": "Working families and businesses would benefit from statewide program\n\nHONOLULU, February 5, 2020 — A statewide Paid Family Leave program is one step closer to becoming law after advancing through a Senate committee yesterday.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Labor, Culture, and the Arts unanimously passed SB2491 on Feb. 4, which would allow all workers to take paid, job-protected leave to care for their families. This measure dovetails with the Legislature’s focus in the 2020 session on issues affecting working families.\n\nPaid Family Leave was one of Governor David Ige’s priorities during his re-election campaign. In 2018, Gov. Ige said that “Paid family leave would benefit Hawaiʻi’s working families, and I fully support the Legislature’s efforts to establish a plan for moving it forward.” Last year, the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau completed a study showing how Hawaiʻi can implement a statewide Paid Family Leave program, based on models from other states. Eight states and Washington, DC already have Paid Family Leave programs.\n\nHawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN) and the Working Families Coalition have long advocated for statewide Paid Family Leave. In response to the decision yesterday, Deborah Zysman, HCAN Executive Director, said:\n\n“We’re grateful to Senator Brian Taniguchi and the Senate Committee on Labor, Culture, and the Arts for putting families first. Paid Family Leave will improve the lives of Hawaiʻi’s keiki, especially those in working families struggling to make ends meet. It will lift up all workers, businesses, and families, and help build a thriving economy and healthy community for all of Hawaiʻi.”\n\nThe typical worker cannot afford to take unpaid leave to care for their family, and most are not offered paid leave through their jobs. As Aloha United Way’s 2017 ALICE report showed, 48% of Hawaiʻi households are struggling to afford basic needs. Through a statewide Paid Family Leave program, all workers could take job-protected leave to care for new babies, newly adopted children, kūpuna, or loved ones with a serious injury or illness.\n\nContact: Ryan Catalani\nrcatalani@hawaii-can.org\n(808) 531-5502 ext. 4\n\nHCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman is available for press interviews.\n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children.

They are calling it a building block to creating a state-funded preschool program in Hawaii.\n\n\"Hawaii is one of 11 states in the country that does not publicly fund early learning and by having a school readiness program, we're really putting ourselves on the path towards being able to say that our youngest of keiki need to make sure that they have a good foundation to be ready for school,\" said state Sen. Jill Tokuda.\n\nThe measure would set aside more than $7 million to expand Preschool Open Doors, a state-run child care program managed by the Department of Human Services.\n\nTokuda said, \"It's a strong investment. I think that's going to yield so much rewards.\"\n\nGov. Neil Abercrombie said, \"The state of Hawaii can now demonstrate its commitment to preparing our youth by ensuring that high quality child care and early education will be available, accessible and affordable.\"\n\nBut the bill is only a fraction of the $30 million Abercrombie's been rallying for to fund an early-education initiative for thousands of preschoolers.\nLawmakers say much of that money went to fund recently settled union contracts.\n\nStill, those involved say they're excited.\n\n\"For us, this has really been about access and equity for all of our children, regardless of income that we know this is what will give our kids the best start,\" said Good Beginnings Alliance Executive Director Deborah Zysman.\n\nLast week, lawmakers advanced a bill to fund a program for all preschoolers if voters support a constitutional amendment that allows public funds to be spent on private programs.\n\n\"We know that early education is key to so many different things,\" Zysman said. \"To school test scores, to graduation rates to lowering even things like our future incarceration and other issues.\"\n\nBoth bills will go before the full House and Senate next week for a final vote.\n\nThe Hawaii State Teachers Association opposes the constitutional amendment, calling it a school voucher program.",

      "title": "Facing child abuse: Changes 20 years after Kema case",
      "publication": "Star Advertiser",
      "excerpt": "Nearly two decades have passed since 6-year-old Peter “Peter Boy” Kema was reported missing from his Hawaii island home. And at long last, some closure is near in the troubling case of child abuse and neglect.\n\nRather than stand trial this month in connection with his son’s death, Peter Kema Sr. has opted for a plea deal, accepting a charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors have said the boy likely died from septic shock from not getting medical care.\n\nMuch has changed since June 1997, when Peter Boy was last seen alive by his siblings: More protective laws are in place and child welfare agencies and advocates increasingly point to encouraging results tied to abuse prevention programs and efforts to engage families in crisis to heal together and forge lasting healthy relationships.\n\nAmong recently enacted federal legislation — signed into law by President Barack Obama in late December — is a measure that gives an added layer of protection to abused children on military bases. Sadly, Talia’s Law was prompted by a brutal case of child abuse at Oahu’s Wheeler Army Airfield.\n\nIn July 2005, when Talia Williams was 5 years old, her father punched her so hard that she fell backward, hit her head on a concrete floor and died at her family’s base home. During the emotional courtroom proceedings that followed, jurors heard about a pattern of beatings and the military’s inadequate internal- focused policy of dealing with cases of child abuse.\n\nUnder Talia’s Law, physicians, social workers, teachers and other professionals who serve military personnel and their families are now required also to report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect directly to state Child Protective Services or its equivalent agency. In Hawaii, it’s the Child Welfare Services Branch within the Department of Human Services.\n\n“Horrendous and tragic cases such as Peter Boy and Talia Williams point out why more than ever we need to do more and a better job through prevention of child abuse,” said Karen Tan, chief program officer for Child & Family Service, a nonprofit that provides counseling and therapeutic services for families contending with poverty, abuse and neglect issues.\n\n“Preventing child abuse before it ever occurs is the ideal solution in terms of protecting children and is also the least costly, both financially and socially to our society,” Tan said.\n\nHawaii’s state lawmakers have been weighing abuse-related bills that stress abuse prevention and beneficial intervention in crisis cases as well as alignment with federal legislation pertaining to sex trafficking.\n\n>> Senate Bill 711 would initiate state funding for Family-Child Interaction Learning (FCIL) programs, such as Tutu and Me and Keiki Steps, which are currently funded with federal dollars and private donations.\n\nIn testimony supporting the bill, Hawaii Children’s Action Network (HCAN) said: “There are numerous, high-quality programs across our state that provide culturally relevant, multi-generational, parenting skills and child development programs for low-income, at-risk families. Currently, there is not an avenue for these programs to be supported by the state, which dramatically limits the number of families they can serve.” Statewide, FCIL programs serve more than 3,100 children, almost half of whom are under age three.\n\nStruggles with parenting skills rank as the most common factor precipitating cases of child abuse, according to the most recent Hawaii Department of Human Services Databook.\n\nDuring the 2015 calendar year, there were 3,704 reports of child abuse/ neglect. (That tally includes 1,458 confirmed cases.) The top three factors cited as giving rise to abuse incidents in confirmed cases: “inability to cope with parenting responsibility,” affecting 70 percent of cases; “unacceptable child-rearing methods,” 60 percent; and drug abuse, 47 percent.\n\nThe Hawaii Databook, which also breaks down victim counts by ethnic identification, notes that in nearly half of the 2015 cases (46 percent), the victims were Native Hawaiian or part-Hawaiian, underscoring a need to continue ongoing pushes conducted by child welfare agencies to address that community.\n\n>> Senate Bill 469 designates funding for the state’s judiciary. The nonprofit HCAN is asking legislators to fold in money for continuation of a family court program that handles hearings and conferences for selected cases involving children from birth to age 3. “Zero to 3 Court” strives for safety and stability in homes with frequent monitoring of the child’s well-being and linking families to the early intervention.\n\nDeborah Zysman, HCAN’s executive director, said, “This specialized court is often involved in child abuse/neglect, and we feel it’s important to continue to have folks with specialized skills and training” involved in such cases — rather than concentrating largely on imposing stiff penalties for offenders.\n\n>> House Bill 930 would create and allot funding for an “Erin’s Law” task force to review policies and curricula for educating public schoolchildren about sexual abuse and sex trafficking prevention. Twenty-six states have passed a version of Erin’s Law, which was named after an Illinois girl — a childhood sexual assault survivor and activist.\n\nIn testimony, Parents And Children Together (PACT) said: “We support Erin’s Law because it recommends (age-appropriate) child sexual abuse prevention education should be taught in grades as early as pre-kindergarten through high school.” It also calls for training school staff and faculty about prevention and how to handle sexual abuse disclosures.\n\nPACT is a nonprofit that assists families statewide with early education programs and prevention/intervention efforts targeting child abuse and domestic violence, among other services.\n\n>> House Bill 1099 would bring the state into compliance with the federal Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (2015) and the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (2010) by amending a definition of “child abuse or neglect” to include sex trafficking. It would also clarify that child abuse and neglect reports expunged in the state’s central registry may be retained by the Human Services Department for future “risk and safety” assessment.\n\nAmong this year’s federal priorities being tracked by advocates and agencies is proposed congressional re-authorization of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program. Since 2010, it has supported high-risk families in all 50 states with home-visiting services geared to improve prenatal health, prevent child abuse and neglect, and promote school readiness.\n\nPrevent Child Abuse America said: “Hawaii gets a lot of funding for our programs from this (program). We and others are mobilizing to try to preserve funds from the federal chopping block.”\n\nKayle M. Perez, the state’s Child Welfare Services Branch administrator, said the agency — along with others nationwide — gauges risk with an assessment tool known as the Differential Response System. In cases of low- and moderate-risk, the agency may connect a family with various social service programs.\n\nIn high-risk cases, a crisis response, which could result in a child being removed from a home, can be launched within two hours.\n\nMuch has changed since the late 1990s, when a photo of a smiling boy’s face, accompanied by the question, “So … Where’s Peter?” appeared on orange-and-black bumper stickers and signs in the islands.\n\nIn decades past, it was not uncommon for people in Hawaii and elsewhere to look the other way when a child had bruises, broken bones or a black eye from an apparent beating. Today, the argument that such matters are no one’s business except for the family involved, is no longer acceptable.\n\nRecognizing and confronting child abuse when it surfaces is everyone’s business.\n\n“We cannot do this alone,” Perez said. To most effectively address child abuse and neglect, Child Welfare Services needs involvement on the part of various communities, neighborhoods and families as well as other agencies and government. “It takes that whole village to really support children and families.”\n\nIn cases of suspected child abuse or neglect, an anonymous report can be submitted to the state Department of Human Services on the Child Abuse Hotline. On Oahu, 832-5300; and neighbor islands, 1-800-494-3991.\n\nBE VIGILANT, BE PART OF SOLUTION TO SUPPORT CHILDREN & FAMILIES IN NEED\n\nRows of spinning pinwheels now planted in the state Capitol’s lawn are part of a nationwide effort to spotlight ongoing child abuse and neglect prevention efforts. The month-long campaign’s breeze-powered blue-and-silver toys symbolize hope for a happy childhood.\n\nInitiated nine years ago by Prevent Child Abuse America, the annual displays aim to spur conversation about child abuse and neglect — a topic that can be uncomfortable to broach but, when frankly addressed, can yield lifesaving results.\n\nThe organizers of the Honolulu display — Prevent Child Abuse Hawaii, Child Abuse Planning Prevention Council and the state of Hawaii’s Department of Health — are asking passersby to think about and discuss three questions:\n\n>> How can we prevent child abuse and neglect?\n\n>> Why do you think child abuse and neglect happens?\n\n>> What are traits of a healthy family?\n\nSince 1983, April has been designated as national Child Abuse Prevention Month. In the islands, the annual observance aims to raise awareness with events ranging from sign-waving at busy downtown intersections to family story times held at public libraries and on military bases.\n\nPrevent Child Abuse Hawaii’s executive director, Aileen Deese, said the nonprofit also works in tandem with the local military community and others on year-round programs such as a teddy bear drive, through which stuffed animals are collected for children in crisis.\n\n“It is easier than you think to make an impact on children in your community,” Deese said. She suggests: mentoring by way of coaching a sports team or volunteering to help staff extracurricular school-related programs, and calling or writing to elected officials to express support for prevention services.\n\n“When children and parents get the support and help they need, good things happen,” she said.\n\nMore information is available online at preventchildabusehawaii.org.",

Currently a family making $25,000 or below receives a lackluster tax credit of up to $600 for one child, while the average cost of childcare for a single child in Hawaii is $13,000.\n• Urging the Department of Human Services to increase the reimbursement rate for home childcare facilities and to ease the eligibility criteria for receiving child care subsidies.\n• Allocating funding for the operating budget of the Department of Education’s Executive Office on Early Learning that supports the classroom expansion desperately needed so that more of Hawaiiʻs keiki have access to high-quality and affordable early learning.\n• Allocating $4 million to maintain and continue the current federally funded 18 existing charter school prekindergarten classrooms across the state serving approximately 360 children, including 7 Native Hawaiian immersion and culture-based prekindergarten charter school.\n• Extending the deadline for the Legislative Reference Bureau to submit the sunrise analysis on implementing a paid family leave program in Hawaii. Currently, 0% of Hawaii’s workers have guaranteed paid family leave. In a state where family and aloha are the foundation of our society, it is crucial to allot time to care for family or loved ones without the threat of losing oneʻs income or job.\n\nAdvocates say legislators need to put keiki first. \n\n\"I think we should lead by example. I don't think we should be trailing behind. I think we should be the pioneers, the progressive pioneers across the state. That's what I believe because it's part of our identity and who we are,\" said Dean Wong, Executive Director of Imua Family Sservices.\n\nAdvocates are also fighting for a paid family leave program to help new parents care for newborn children. \n\nCopyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

      "publication": "",
      "excerpt": "WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced a bipartisan resolution to ensure the 2020 Census is fair and accurate. The resolution encourages individuals, families, and households across the United States to take part in the Census so that all communities can be counted.\n\nHCAN is proud to endorse this resolution. As part of our commitment to ensure all keiki are counted in the 2020 Census, HCAN is convening the Hawaiʻi Kids Complete Count Committee. Learn more here.\n\n“The Census is mandated by the Constitution and plays a vital role in our democracy, ensuring that every person is counted and receives the representation and services they deserve,” said Senator Schatz. “This is an opportunity for us to make clear Congress’ commitment to achieving an accurate count and reaching all communities.”\n\n“Census data is essential for the government to make informed decisions about the future of its people and ensure that all Americans have equal representation. I’m proud to join Senator Schatz on this bipartisan resolution that recognizes the importance and the significance of the 2020 Census and ensures it is quick, concise, and easy to complete,” said Senator Murkowski. “As the largest and most rural state, Alaska has one of the hardest populations to count in the decennial U.S. Census. Accurate census data provides crucial information for research and planning purposes, directing fair funding allotments for the federal programs that are vital to rural and Native American populations, and enabling the enforcement of federal nondiscrimination laws. I’m glad to shine a spotlight on our efforts to ensure an accurate census and look forward to the first census count in the nation that will take place in Toksook Bay, Alaska in January 2020.”\n\nThe 2020 Census is a constitutionally mandated undertaking. The data collected is used to properly allocate seats for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures. It also directs more than $800 billion annually in federal funding to state and local communities.\n\nThe resolution recognizes the importance and significance of the 2020 Census and encourages all people to participate. It concludes that it is the civic duty of every person to ensure that the 2020 Census is as accurate as possible.\n\nThe Schatz-Murkowski resolution is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D- Hawai‘i), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).\n\nThe resolution is supported by a number of organizations including the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, National the Association of Towns and Townships, the Census Project, NAACP, NALEO Educational Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, National Congress of American Indians, Service Employees International Union, National Education Association, Nielsen, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google.",

The need in Hawaiʻi is dire: Nearly 1 in 2 families struggle to afford basic needs.\n\n“We all agree we’re starting at the right place so all Hawaiʻi families can thrive,” said Gavin Thornton, Executive Director of Hawaiʻi Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice. “We must all remain fully committed to creating and passing policies that truly impact working families to the degree that’s so desperately needed.”\n\nHawaiʻi Children’s Action Network, Hawaiʻi Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, and Faith Action for Community Equity share a vision for Hawaiʻi where everyone can afford to live, work, and raise a family.\n\n“This is a needed first step, and as we work toward this vision, we look forward to including the voices of the working families who will be most affected by these policies,” said Ashleigh Loa, Executive Director of Faith Action for Community Equity. “We want to keep up the momentum with this inclusive process and make Hawaiʻi work for working families.”\n\nHawaiʻi Children’s Action Network, Hawaiʻi Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, and Faith Action for Community Equity have no comment on any specific legislation until more details are released.",

      "excerpt": "DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\n\nDAVID Y. IGE\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nVIRGINIA PRESSLER, M.D.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nHawaii State Department of Health leads oral health screening initiative for every Head Start and Early Head Start student\n\nGrants from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the HDS Foundation enable earlier oral health intervention\n\nHONOLULU – The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH), in collaboration with the Hawaii Children’s Action Network, Head Start Collaboration Office, and Hawaii Head Start and Early Head Start programs, is conducting a statewide oral health screening project, beginning this fall. The project, which focuses on Hawaii keiki who are most at risk for cavities, builds upon the foundation set by the DOH’s Hawaii Smiles statewide third-grade screening project two years ago. The current project will look at younger children and include an oral health screening for every child enrolled in the Head Start and Early Head Start programs.\n\nThe first screening is scheduled at the Parents and Children Together (PACT) headquarters at The Towers at Kuhio Park on Tuesday, Oct. 17, beginning at 10 am. Altogether, more than 2,970 children at more than 100 Head Start and Early Head Start sites statewide will have a dental screening in this school year. The health department will use this data on the oral health of these young children to inform the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and develop policies and programs to improve the oral health of children across Hawaii.\n\nThe Hawaii Smiles statewide screening team is composed of dentists and dental hygienists from the public and private sectors who will evaluate the extent of cavities in these children, provide oral health educational materials for parents and teachers, and offer recommendations for follow-up dental care.\n\n“This project will allow us to better understand the patterns that surround dental decay in families and communities in our state,” said Dr. Gavin Uchida, DOH dental director. “On a community level, we know we must all do much more to improve the oral health of the residents of our state, and this information is foundational in helping us create the smartest, most effective plans for positive change.”\n\nPreviously, DOH issued the 2015/2016 Hawaii Smiles report, which validated that Hawaii’s third grade children have the highest prevalence of tooth decay in the nation. The baseline results were based on data collected from more than 3,000 third grade students in 67 public elementary schools during the 2014-2015 school year.\n\nThe findings from the Hawaii Smiles report were disappointing, but not surprising:\n\n71 percent of third graders in Hawaii have tooth decay, which is higher than the national average of 52 percent;\n22 percent of third graders have untreated tooth decay, indicating they are not receiving dental care;\nAbout 7 percent of third graders are in need of urgent dental care because of pain or infection; and\nThere are significant oral health disparities by income as well as by race/ethnicity among third grade students in Hawaii.\n \n\nWe are grateful that the HDS Foundation is being proactive and funding early solutions to Hawaii's oral health problems,” said Deborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children’s Action Network. “These problems are often preventable when addressed in early for the opportunity to make a difference in the health of Hawaii children.”\n\nAs part of the outreach efforts, parents and teachers will receive oral health educational materials and classroom supplies to reinforce the importance of good oral health to children.\n\nThe Hawaii Smiles report recommended community-based prevention programs that focus on oral health promotion and prevention services in early childhood programs to reach children at a\n\nyounger age. The Early Head Start and Head Start programs were identified because of their extensive reach to children from birth to five years old.\n\n“While this project is organized by the Department of Health, it actually is a growing coalition of local and national community partners who are taking action,” said Dr. Uchida. “We’re seeing the result of partnerships that start with caring individuals and small community groups, and extends to local businesses and associations, and even to national leadership at the CDC. A lot of people are now coming together to address the oral health problems we’re seeing in Hawaii, and this current project is just the beginning of good things to come.“\n\n“We’re pleased to be able to continue our support for the Hawaii Smiles project,” said\nMark Yamakawa, president and CEO of Hawaii Dental Service (HDS). “Prevention is the key to good oral health especially for our young children, and we appreciate the collaborative effort to tackle this important issue in our state.”\n\nThe CDC awarded the DOH a $1.1 million grant to rebuild its oral health program, a portion of which is being used for these oral health screenings for 1,450 children at 50 Head Start and Early Head Start sites throughout the state.\n\nThe HDS Foundation gave a $45,000 grant to the Hawaii Children’s Action Network, which\nis helping to coordinate the logistics of this project, to expand the outreach efforts to an additional 59 sites and to conduct dental screenings for an additional 1,520 infants, toddlers and preschoolers for a total of more than 2,970 children.\n\nChildren will be referred to their dentist for follow-up care. If they do not have a dentist, the DOH and the Head Start and Early Head Start programs will refer families to Community Case Management Corp., which assists Medicaid beneficiaries with finding dentists for treatment.\n\n## #\n\nAbout the Head Start Program and Early Head Start Program\nHead Start (3-4 year olds) and Early Head Start (pregnant women, infants and toddlers) are federally-funded programs that prepare eligible infants, toddlers and preschoolers for school readiness and enhance the lives of their families by offering a two-generational service delivery model that includes comprehensive child development and family support services. The program started as a pilot in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty Program, and has become the largest early childhood program in Hawaii. ",

      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (AP) - Legislative leaders want to boost funding for a program that helps fund preschool for children from low-income families, and say they’ve agreed to increase the budget for the Preschool Open Doors to $10 million.\n\nA budget committee with members from the House and Senate announced Tuesday they want to increase the program’s budget beyond the $6 million Gov. David Ige requested, which would allow an additional 600 children to participate in the program.\n\n“Both committees definitely recognize the importance of making sure our youngest keiki (children) are ready for school regardless of where they live, their families’ ability to pay,” said Sen. Jill Tokuda, chairwoman of the Senate Ways and Means committee, calling the program a “great equalizer.”\n\nThe decision was announced along with other agreements reached over how to spend the state’s $13.5 billion budget for 2017.\n\nBut the House and Senate are waiting until the end to make the toughest decisions, postponing announcements on funding for homelessness services, affordable housing and money for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. They also haven’t agreed to fund 33 new positions in the vector control branch that fights mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever or the Zika virus. While the Senate supported Ige’s February request to fund those positions, the House has not yet agreed, Tokuda said.\n\nThe House and Senate are also still negotiating how much money will go to many capital improvement projects throughout the islands, including a proposed $160 million for Hawaii State Hospital, $30 million for cooling schools, a new $35 million facility for overcrowded Campbell High School and funds to continue construction of a new high school in South Maui.\n\n“We save the cookies until the end,” Tokuda said.\n\nFunding for the financially struggling Wahiawa General Hospital is also up in the air after a plan to help the hospital by buying its parking lots was rejected by the hospital’s board of directors, according to Rep. Marcus Oshiro.\n\nThe budget bill most recently passed by the state Senate includes $13.5 billion in spending for 2017 and $12.9 billion for 2016. That includes money from the state’s general fund, bonds and all other means of financing.\n\nThe joint House and Senate committee will reconvene to announce more budget decisions on Thursday.\n\nCopyright © 2021 The Washington Times, LLC.",

The fourth annual Hawaiʻi Children’s Policy Agenda, convened by Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network, brings together 25 policy priorities from 37 organizations and advocates. Along with the legislative Keiki Caucus package, these initiatives will improve the health, education, and economic well-being of Hawaiʻi’s children and families.\n\nOne major initiative would create a statewide Paid Family Leave program, which Hawaiʻi is ready to implement thanks to a recent nonpartisan study commissioned by the Legislature. Paid Family Leave would allow all workers to take paid, job-protected leave to care for their families. It’s an affordable policy that would benefit both family well-being and the economy.\n\nCommunity leaders will also highlight proposals that would make diapers more affordable for low-income families and create a family visitation center at Waiawa Correctional Center. The Keiki Caucus co-conveners will also share their legislative package priorities.",

And of the available slots statewide, it says only about 11 percent are open to infants and toddlers. \n\nDeborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children's Action Network, says this is troubling because early education is critical during this stage of childhood development. \n\nShe says there are not enough licensed childcare providers or programs out there to meet the demand, and that parents are often faced with long wait lists and expensive tuition.\n\n\"We have families go back to work often when a baby is just a month old and they need to figure out where that baby will be in care up until he or she starts kindergarten,\" said Zysman. \n\nThe report also details the financial impact child care costs can have on families. \n\nIt says single parents in Hawaii are sometimes paying 45-percent of their income for infant care, while a married couple with two kids living at the poverty line could be paying 79-percent of their income. \n\nZysman says the cost of infant care in Hawaii right now is about $1,300 a month. \n\n\"We'd like to see more work in the next few years to help many of our informal caregivers -- family, friends, and neighbors -- become licensed caregivers because it's a great small business to run and I think there's more help coming from the community to run those small businesses,\" said Zysman. \n\nCopyright 2018 Hawaii News Now.

      "title": "Lawmakers advance mandatory paid family leave proposal in Hawaii",
      "publication": "Hawaii News Now",
      "excerpt": "A proposal for mandatory paid family leave in Hawaii sailed through a legislative committee Tuesday.\n\nThe House Committee on Labor and Public Employment voted in favor of the measure and added an amendment to create a Paid Family Leave Small Business Supplementation Fund to help offset costs for small businesses with a maximum of 10 employees.\n\nIt's now headed to the House Finance Committee, before it's set to be heard by the full body.\n\nCurrently, the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows 12 weeks of unpaid leave to employees working at businesses that employ 50 or more people. Hawaii law offers an additional four-week extension for unpaid leave, but only for workers of companies with more than 100 employees.\n\nBut Senate Bill 2990 would establish a framework of policies needed to implement paid family leave so that all employees in Hawaii have access to leave benefits during times when they need to provide care for a family member, whether that’s the birth or adoption of a child, or a spouse or parent with a serious health condition. \n\nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, Jessica McDonald told lawmakers that after giving birth last year, she used up her vacation and sick days in about six weeks. She went back to work because she couldn't afford to go without a paycheck any longer. Her daughter, Quinn, died of a sudden illness two days after McDonald returned to her job.\n\n\"While I will never know whether I could have saved Quinn, what I do know is that I spent Quinn's last day at work. I didn't get to hold her one last time, kiss her little cheeks, rock her to sleep, and this will forever haunt me,\" said the Kaneohe resident.\n\nSB 2990 has the support of Gov. David Ige, and a number of unions and nonprofits. Supporters say paid family leave is long overdue and studies have shown that the benefit serves businesses in the long-run by helping to retain experienced employees. \n\nAccording to officials with the Hawaii State Teachers Association, “Sickness should not become a debt sentence.” A union representative says it’s time for the state to take better care of families living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBut paid family leave is opposed by the Hawaii Chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management and the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii.\n\n\"Our concern is, what are the unintended consequences and the overall impact on the business community, which in turn can impact the type of benefits that employers provide?\" explained Sherry Menor-McNamara, president of the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii.\n\nChamber officials say workplace mandates affect the ability for employers to sustain and create jobs, as well as provide benefits to employees.\n\nWhile the details of the program still need to be worked out by a task force, opponents have expressed their concerns over who will pay for the paid family leave benefit and the ultimate impact on the business community to execute costs.\n\n\"What this bill does, it adds added burden and cost onto a lot of the retailers and businesses. There's only so much a retailer or business can absorb and then the rest gets passed on to the customer,\" said Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii.\n\nSupporters said an affordable solution would be to have paid family leave operate as a social insurance program.\n\n\"The way it's being proposed, businesses would not pay for it. We all, workers, would pay into a fund managed by the state and we would all be able to take out so it's an insurance program which also makes it really cheap,\" said Deborah Zysman, executive director of the Hawaii Children's Action Network.\n\nCopyright 2018 Hawaii News Now.

      "excerpt": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) -\n\nWith proposed national budget cuts under the new presidential administration, there are looming concerns for Hawai‘i’s nonprofit organizations that could include loss of government funding in some mission areas. Some nonprofits and the services they provide are likely to take big hits to their budget revenue as early as the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.\n\nOn Aug. 24, the Hawai‘i Community Foundation (HCF) will be holding its Advancing Nonprofit Excellence conference to provide Hawai‘i’s nonprofits with insights and advice on the impacts the federal budget cuts will have on the state and services that local nonprofits provide and how Hawai‘i nonprofits can better advocate for themselves and on behalf of their communities\n\n“The federal government through grants and contracts and funding of nonprofit services through funding of state governments is a major revenue source for our nonprofits,” said Micah Kane, president and CEO of the Hawai‘i Community Foundation. “Health care services, programs that benefit the Native Hawaiians, homeless, arts and the environment will all be impacted with the proposed federal budget cuts and Hawai‘i’s nonprofits need to find ways to make up for the loss in support and funding. And unfortunately, philanthropy alone will not be able to fill that gap.”   \n\nRegistration is $125 per person for the event and is open here. Nonprofit executive directors and board members are encouraged to attend the conference, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort Coral Ballrooms.\n\nCopyright 2017.

      "excerpt": "Still, Hawaii parents and advocates for children say even a scaled-down version of Biden’s proposed programs for children and families would be instrumental in helping Hawaii families stay afloat given the state’s high cost of living.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has been tangled up in negotiations since the House passed a $3.5 trillion version of Biden’s Build Back Better plan, which also included universal pre-kindergarten, subsidies for child care and a provision to make the refundable child tax credit permanent.\n\nThe New York Times reported the plan was originally envisioned as the greatest expansion of the social safety net since President Lyndon Johnson’s administration created Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBut the combination of opposition from Republicans and moderate Democrats has forced Democrats to carve out huge aspects of the bill, eliminating free community college and key climate change provisions and reducing the estimated cost to between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion.\n\nKathleen Algire from Hawaii Children’s Action Network Speaks says the federal funding proposed for universal pre-K would give Hawaii the boost it needs to expand its small program and meet the state’s ambitious enrollment goals.\n\nResearch shows that access to pre-K benefits child development.\n\n“It is not a hyperbole when we say this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve people’s lives,” Algire said of the family-related proposals in Biden’s plan. “It would benefit not just our current generation but generations to come.”\n\nTo Algire, this moment recalls the 1970s, when then-President Richard Nixon vetoed a bill that would have provided universal child care.\n\n“We don’t want to wait another 50 years to have something like this,” Algire said.",

      "excerpt": "Study, commissioned by Legislature, paves the way for Paid Family Leave\n\nAll working families could care for both keiki and kūpuna under proposals\n\nHONOLULU, November 14, 2019 — With a new report released today, Hawaiʻi has everything it needs to allow all workers to take paid, job-protected leave to care of their families.\n\nThis study, commissioned by the Legislature in 2018 and published by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau, shows how Hawaiʻi could implement a statewide Paid Family Leave program, based on models from other states. Eight states and Washington, DC already have Paid Family Leave programs.\n\nThe typical worker cannot afford to take unpaid leave to care for their family, and most are not offered paid leave through their jobs. As Aloha United Way’s 2017 ALICE report showed, 48% of Hawaiʻi households are struggling to afford basic needs. Through a statewide Paid Family Leave program, all workers could take job-protected leave to care for new babies, newly adopted children, kūpuna, or loved ones with a serious injury or illness.\n\nHawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN) and its statewide coalitions have long advocated for statewide Paid Family Leave. In response to the report, Deborah Zysman, HCAN Executive Director, said:\n\n“It’s time to put families first. Thanks to this report commissioned by the Legislature, Hawaiʻi is ready to be the next state with Paid Family Leave. We’re excited to work with legislators in 2020 to pass a plan that Hawaiʻi’s working families deserve. A Paid Family Leave program will improve the lives of Hawaiʻi’s keiki, especially those in ALICE households struggling to make ends meet. It will lift up all workers, businesses, and families, and help build a thriving economy and healthy community for all of Hawaiʻi.”\n\nThe report shows that Paid Family Leave is smart for businesses and taxpayers alike.\n\nMost people will need to take time off to care for their families at some point. The study confirms that workers with paid leave are more likely to return to their jobs, and that Paid Family Leave could “contribute to U.S. economic growth.”\nHawaiʻi workers could receive up to 16 weeks of paid leave, as the report models. Like in other states, lower earners would receive a higher percentage of their wages.\nPrevious research showed that Paid Family Leave could cost the typical Hawaiʻi worker just $1.11 per week, with no additional ongoing cost to taxpayers. Statewide polling has shown that about 3 in 5 Hawaiʻi workers are already willing to fund Paid Family Leave through their paychecks.\n \n\nHCAN Executive Director Deborah Zysman is available for press interviews.\n\nDownload the report: http://lrbhawaii.org/reports/legrpts/lrb/2020/paidfamilyleave.pdf\n\nDownload HCAN’s 2017 study on Paid Family Leave: http://bit.ly/hcanpfl\n\nAbout Hawaiʻi Children’s Action Network (HCAN): HCAN is a nonprofit creating a unified voice for Hawaiʻi’s children.

      "excerpt": "The state legislature is also focusing on Keiki this session.\n\nThe Legislative Keiki Caucus is sponsoring 24 senate and house bills focusing on the education, health and well-being of children in Hawai’i. The Zero to 3 Court specializes in cases of abused or neglected infants and toddlers by providing judicial oversight and social services. Senator Karl Rhoads is a Keiki Caucus member and chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n“If a baby has parents that care about him or her, the zero to three court ruling never comes into play. It’s the ones who neglect or abuse their children, where the court can intervene and try to be sure that they get off to a good start in life, because, if you don’t, it’s just really difficult to get yourself back on track after you’re 3 years old.”\n\nThe Keiki Caucus is requesting 18 million dollars to fund 22 new public pre-kindergarten classrooms to serve 800 children. It’s also asking for 4-million to provide state funding for pre-school classes at 11 Hawai’i Charter Schools statewide. Executive Director, Sione Thompson, says the Pre-K classes serve 360 children in high-need areas.\n\n“We really targeted and focused on rural areas where there was a limited or no access to quality pre-schools. So, we really want to see the progress over time. We want to see how they enter kindergarten. How, from kindergarten into third grade, how their progress on indicators like literacy and numeracy. And we’re really, really excited to track that progress.”\n\nThe Charter Pre-K program was funded by a Federal Preschool Development Grant that expires this year. The Keiki Caucus is also seeking funding to continue after-school programs for children. Washington Middle School Eighth-Grader Siaki Tuitavake is one of 11-hundred students enrolled in after school programs on O’ahu and the Big Island.\n\n“Afterschool Allstars runs for 3 hours every day after school. This program includes an hour of homework or tutoring, opportunity to attend free after school classes such as basketball, cooking, graphic designs, advanced robotics and Polynesian dance. Students in Afterschool Allstars are less likely to be chronically absent and are less likely to have D’s and F’s on their report cards.”\n\nBut, 40 percent of Hawai’i’s children live in households with a high housing cost burden. The Hawai’i Children’s Action Network is a coalition of 30 advocacy organizations. Executive Director, Deborah Zysman, says the focus will be on all the building blocks that make children successful.\n\n“We need to make sure that families have a living wage, that we have good quality early care in education. So, while families are going to work they have child care, we have quality pre-school and then, how do we make sure our schools are getting the support they need. Are teachers able to teach and that we have good after school programs.”\n\nFor HPR News, I’m Wayne Yoshioka.",

      "publication": "State of Reform",
      "excerpt": "Hawaii ranks sixth in the nation for child health, but the state’s child economic well-being ranking plummeted from 25th to 44th in just one year, according to a study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The state ranked 26th overall for child well being, a drop from 17th in the nation last year. \n\nThe study measured child well-being with 16 indicators across four categories: economic well-being, education, health, and family and community. However, the study does not yet reflect additional negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nDeborah Zysman, executive director of Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network, says state leaders should take action now.\n\n“By revealing that Hawai‘i’s keiki were falling behind the rest of the nation even before the pandemic, the newest KIDS COUNT Data Book should be a warning bell to everyone who cares about our state’s children. Policymakers and community leaders must act boldly to prevent our children’s well-being from deteriorating further.”\n\nHawaii has performed worse over time on two of the four indicators the study used to measure child health. Child and teen deaths per 100,000 increased from 21 in 2010 to 24 in 2019. Hawaii had a total of 1,410 low birth-weight babies in 2019, a 0.1 percent increase from 2010.\n\nRegarding the state’s economic well-being, the study estimated 36,000 children, or 12 percent, lived in poverty in 2019. Hawaii ranks well nationally in child poverty, but Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network says this is most likely because the official poverty line does not factor in the high cost of living in the state. \n\nAlthough the study does not reflect the effect of the pandemic, additional survey data from the Census Bureau shows that in March 2021, 61 percent of Hawaii households with children reported losing employment income since the start of the pandemic. That number is disproportionately higher than the national average of 49 percent. To address the economic well-being gap, Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network recommends a range of solutions. \n\n“Our state’s leaders should prioritize investing in children, families and communities to ensure an equitable and expansive recovery. These priorities include boosting the Earned Income Tax Credit, expanding early learning programs, enacting paid family and sick leave and adopting student-centered budgeting.”",

      "publication": "",
      "excerpt": "(HONOLULU, HI – May 4, 2017) – The passage of the American Health Care Act by the U.S.  House of Representatives will have a devastating impact on Hawaii’s children and families.  Congress rushed this through before getting an independent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  That means that our nation’s leaders and their constituents have no idea how much worse it’s gotten and how many more people will lose coverage.\n\nAt a minimum, we know that the bill decimates Medicaid, cutting more than $800 billion over 10 years, and resulting in at least 24 million more uninsured people within a decade.  It will put many of our most vulnerable Americans at risk, including children, people with disabilities and pregnant women.  And it places a cap on federal funding for Medicaid, blowing a hole in our state’s budget and local taxpayers to foot the bill.  This arbitrary cap on Medicaid will put 145,323 of Hawaii's children in harm's way, including: \n\n100% of children in foster care;\n78% of children living in or near poverty;\n39% of children with disabilities or other special health care needs;\n38% of infant, toddlers and preschoolers; and\n24% of newborns in low income families.\n \n\nThis measure also opens the door for insurers to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, putting kids with asthma, diabetes, heart defects and other conditions at risk.  The recent addition of $8 billion to fund high-risk pools comes nowhere close to covering the cost of care for these kids and other people suffering from pre-existing conditions.  The bill also rolls back the Medicaid expansion that has improved the financial stability for low income families in Hawaii.\n\nHawaii Children’s Action Network recently detailed how changes to Medicaid would harm our children and place additional pressure on our state budget.\n\nWe thank House Representatives Hanabusa and Gabbard standing up for children, seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant women, families, and those with pre-existing conditions whose lives are at risk if this bill becomes law.  And we’re counting on Senators Hirono and Schatz to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect Medicaid.",

      "excerpt": "Tuesday, January 14th, 2020 - Gov. David Ige along with leaders from the state House and Senate announced a new package that includes tax relief, affordable-housing plans and a preschool development program. These initiates aim to provide cost-of-living relief to Hawaii’s low-income and working-class residents.\n\nThis bill packages specifically includes an increase to the state minimum wage to $13 an hour by 2024, and a plan to have about $75 million per year in tax relief for less wealthy households. Additionally, the package contains a “Learning to Grow” initiative, that plans to use public funds to expand the amount of preschools available to children.  \n\nIn regards to the tax plan, it would create a new refundable state earned income tax credit that could potentially help about 90,000 Hawaii taxpayers.\n\nThe refundable state income tax credit “is huge for low-income working families,” said Gavin Thornton, executive director of the nonprofit Hawai‘i Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice. “We’re absolutely thrilled with that piece of this.”\n\n“The thing that I’m most excited about is the coming together,” Thornton said. “This type of thing hasn’t happened before where you’ve had the Legislature, the administration, business leaders, nonprofits getting together in the same room to try to figure out these problems, and the focus is on Hawaii’s struggling families.”\n\nFor advocacy groups including ours, Hawai‘i Children’s Action Network, Faith Action for Community Equity (FACE) and Appleseed, we have issued a joint statement that states we “have no comment on any specific legislation until more details are released.”",

      "publication": "Star Advertiser",
      "excerpt": "“Low-income kids tend to fall behind higher-income kids in the summer.”\n\nNicole Woo, Senior policy analyst, Hawaii Appleseed\n\nHawaii is stagnating in its care for children, especially in education and economic well-being, according to this year’s annual Kids Count Data Book report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\n\nThe report, released today, ranked Hawaii 24th in the country for the overall well-being of children for the second straight year, and a closer look shows that Hawaii has made minimal improvements, if any, in key areas.\n\n“That improvement has not kept pace, and other states have had greater improvements,” said Ivette Rodriguez Stern, junior specialist in program development at the University of Hawaii’s Center on the Family.\n\nThe report breaks up the overall well-being of children into four categories: economic well-being, education, health and family and community. The most alarming rankings are for children’s economic well-being and education, in which the state ranks 34th and 40th, respectively.\n\nThe problems in education start early, as 54% of children ages 3 and 4 in Hawaii are not in school, a 1% increase over 2018’s report and a 10% increase since 2009. The national average for 2019 is 52%, which is the same as it was in 2009.\n\nThe problem is that preschools and other child care services in Hawaii have not grown, while the number of children who need those services has.\n\n“The number of seats for kids 3 and 4 years old has remained the same, but the number of children in that age range has gone up,” said Deborah Zysman, executive director of Hawaii Children’s Action Network. “So we’re not keeping up.”\n\nZysman said much of the country is doing more than Hawaii for younger children.\n\n“We have many other states across the nation that have had much more rapid expansion of public preschool and comprehensive quality child care than Hawaii has,” she said. “We have been growing, but at a much slower pace.”\n\nZysman said that having kids in school at that age is important because it takes advantage of a crucial developmental stage in their lives, which has a lasting effect throughout their education.\n\n“We still see rather alarming numbers of kids who are getting to kindergarten, and kindergarten teachers noting that they’re not really ready,” she said. “By the end of kindergarten, they really want children to be reading. So, that means if they’re entering kindergarten not really knowing their ABCs, they’re behind already.”\n\nShe said there are a number of reasons why kids don’t participate in preschool or other child care services, including there not being any of those services in the community, and even if they are available, they are expensive.\n\nAccording to the report, the quality of K-12 education hasn’t changed at all in Hawaii from last year, which means it’s still bad: 68% of fourth-graders aren’t proficient in reading, 73% of eighth-graders aren’t proficient in math and 17% of high school students don’t graduate on time. Hawaii is below the national average in all three of those categories.\n\nThe low-quality education for children in Hawaii is tied to their poor economic well- being. And one reason why children in Hawaii are ranked poorly in economic well-being, according to the report, is because 36% of them — which is worse than the national average — live in a household burdened with high housing costs.\n\nThose households allocate more than 30% of their income on housing and are considered “cost burdened” by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which means they might find it difficult to afford other basic needs like food, health care and educational programs such as preschool and summer programs.\n\nNicole Woo, senior policy analyst at Hawaii Appleseed, said that during summer, kids who can’t afford to attend summer programs, such as summer school or camps, suffer from “summer slide,” in which they lose more learned information from the school year than kids who can afford those programs.\n\n“Low-income kids tend to fall behind higher-income kids in the summer, in terms of math and reading,” she said. “And the effect of summer slide is cumulative, so it gets worse and worse the older they get.”\n\nStudies have shown that family income is correlated with SAT scores, with lower-income students achieving lower scores.\n\nCompounding the high housing costs and overall costs of living are the low wages in Hawaii.\n\n“When you look at the absolute dollar amount, we look like we’re doing pretty well, but if you adjust for our cost of living, we end up having the lowest average wage in the nation,” Woo said.\n\nHawaii was close in this year’s Legislative session to increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour from $10.10 for employers who don’t provide health coverage and $12.50 for those who do, but that measure died near the end of the session.",

      "title": "Hawaii Has Dropped To The Bottom 10 States In Children’s Economic Well-Being\n",
      "publication": "Civil Beat",
      "excerpt": "Even before the COVID-19 crisis, it was getting tougher to raise a family in Hawaii. A new report released in June shows that pre-pandemic, our children’s economic well-being plummeted from 25th to 44th in the nation.\n\nWhen we talk to caregivers across the state, their stories mirror the data. Summer Yadao is one parent who knows this firsthand. A mother of three, she’s been juggling her full-time job with having to care for her kids. With rising costs and limited public support for families, it’s challenging for families like hers to make ends meet.\n\n“People are working three or four jobs” to pay for groceries, rent, utilities and cell phones — not to mention all the little things for work and school — Summer told us. “It’s depleting to your body, your soul, your ability to care for your children, your ability to function.”\n\nThis struggle is reflected in the 2021 KIDS COUNT Data Book, which explores how families in all 50 states are faring and is released annually by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Collecting and analyzing data from all across the country takes some time, so this report uses data from 2019 — the latest available.\n\nWe should all be concerned that Hawaii dropped to the bottom 10 states in children’s economic well-being. It’s a major red flag that the economic situation for families is so precarious, without even taking into account the pandemic’s impact. It took our state’s lowest-income families a decade to recover from the Great Recession. Now, we are once again facing the threat of a greater share of our keiki growing up in economic hardship, which can have long-lasting effects on education and future employment.\n\nIn this year’s Data Book, Hawaii also dropped from 17th to 26th in overall child well-being rankings. The overall rankings take into account economic well-being, education, health and family and community context.\n\nTwo statistics in particular explain our state’s sharp decline in economic well-being. First, Hawaii fell to 49th in the nation for the percentage of children in households that spend more than 30% of their income on housing. In 2019, 38% of children in our state were living in households that were housing cost-burdened. Second, one in 10 teens aged 16 to 19 were not attending school and not working in 2019, placing them at 47th in the nation.\n\nThe pandemic is likely to worsen those trends. The warning signs are here already: As of March 2021, 61% of Hawaii households with children reported losing employment income since the start of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau (in comparison, the national average was 49%). This wide gap highlights the disproportionate economic effect of the pandemic on Hawaii’s families with children.\n\nTo create an equitable and expansive recovery, our state’s lawmakers must prioritize investing in children and their parents.\n\nThis year’s record was mixed. Legislators saved many essential programs that help families stay safe and provide children a strong start in life from budget cuts. Investments in these programs help our communities thrive. But some programs still saw troubling cuts. Unfortunately, we may see fewer children attending early learning classes because of cuts to the Preschool Open Doors program and charter school early learning programs.\n\nWith the knowledge that our children were falling behind the rest of the nation even before the pandemic, our leaders and community must act boldly to prevent their well-being from deteriorating further. Legislators must work to restore and expand child care and early learning programs, boost the Earned Income Tax Credit and enact paid family and sick leave.\n\n“We’re all scared and trying to figure out how to survive,” Summer said. “It’s time to make things more even and balanced.”\n\nWhen the state invests in keiki, we all see the benefits. It’s not just the right thing to do — it’s the smart thing to do for our economy, community and the future of our state.",

Deborah Zysman, the executive director of the nonprofit Hawaiʻi Children's Action Network, said that with more parents returning to the workplace, there is only one open child care spot for every four children. She said the lack of available child care services predates the pandemic. “Leading up to the pandemic, we were seeing declines in the number of child care providers. It's estimated we lost about 20% of our child care spots even before the pandemic,” Zysman said. “Largely they were saying they just couldn't afford it.” Financial support during the pandemic allowed providers to stay open despite fluctuating enrollments as families stayed home. The last of that money ends this year.",
